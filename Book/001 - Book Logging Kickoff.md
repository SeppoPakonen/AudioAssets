Title: Book Logging Kickoff

I created a persistent “Book” for this repository to narrate what I do in first person and to record compact checkpoints for agents. Captain asked me to keep both a human-readable running log and a concise agent-facing index; I set up both and documented the workflow in AGENTS.md so it’s easy to follow going forward.

What I did now
- I created the `Book/` directory to hold this log and its compact entries.
- I wrote this kickoff chapter to explain the purpose and format.
- I added a compact companion entry (`Book/Book Logging Kickoff.md`) summarizing the same actions for agents.
- I updated the root `AGENTS.md` to formalize how we keep these logs up to date and where they live.

Conventions I will follow
- I will write chapters as `Book/%03d - <Title>.md` in first person (“I did X”), referring to him as Captain (he/him).
- I will maintain compact agent notes alongside each chapter as `Book/<Title>.md` with brief bullets and timestamps.
- I will update or add a new chapter whenever I complete a meaningful set of actions, and always create/refresh the compact entry in the same change.
- I will keep entries small, frequent, and factual; longer stories go in the chapter, operational bullets in the compact file.

Next steps I foresee
- Keep the Book up to date after each task we complete.
- Expand with indexes if needed (table of contents), once we have multiple entries.
