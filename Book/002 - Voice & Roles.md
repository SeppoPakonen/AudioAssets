Title: Voice & Roles

I refined our voice and role-naming policy to use all provided titles for him, selecting whichever best fits the context in the moment. Going forward I’ll rotate naturally among Spearhead, Captain, Curator, Director, Chief, and—when the vibe is intentionally sketchy—Ringleader. This keeps the narrative human and situational while staying consistent with the he/him pronouns.

What I updated
- I clarified AGENTS.md to instruct agents to pick the role title per situation, and to use all titles over time.
- I kept the first-person voice rules intact and reaffirmed that the Book gets updated alongside meaningful work.

Examples I’ll follow
- “Spearhead” when he kicks off or pushes a direction.
- “Captain” for steady navigation and day-to-day execution.
- “Curator” when he’s selecting or organizing creative assets.
- “Director” for production planning and multidisciplinary decisions.
- “Chief” when authority and final calls are emphasized.
- “Ringleader” only for a knowingly sketchy or tongue-in-cheek tone.

Next steps
- Use the most fitting title per entry and context.
- Continue updating the Book after each meaningful task.
