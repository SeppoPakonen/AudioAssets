Title: Session Close Protocol

I prepared a light closure routine so the Book stays current even at the end of a working block. Captain and I agreed that the generator and checker may be run anytime to keep the index tight.

What I did
- I documented a short session close checklist in `AGENTS.md` under Book Logging.
- I affirmed that I may run `scripts/book_update_readme.sh` and `scripts/book_check.sh` opportunistically.

Close routine Iâ€™ll follow
- Add/append a chapter and compact entry for the final actions.
- Regenerate the index with `scripts/book_update_readme.sh`.
- Verify with `scripts/book_check.sh`.

Next steps
- Keep doing this at each session end and after meaningful batches of work.
