These are my music and soundfiles. I have composed allmost all of these songs. Files are in open source formats.

Usage is permitted under custom license.
Please contact me for commercial usage.

Songs are sorted to folders based on their original composition year. They show well my learning process. I was 11 years old in 2001, when I started, which should give the perspective.
