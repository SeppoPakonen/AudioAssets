# AudioAssets
My music and soundfiles. Files are mostly in open source, e.g. in TuxGuitar tab files.


## Instructions
### File extensions:
- .tg files can be opened with TuxGuitar
- .gp4 and .gp5 can be opened with TuxGuitar, or GuitarPro 4 and later.


### TuxGuitar
Enable "FluidSynth output plugin" in plugins and add [FluidR3_GM.sf2](http://www.ronimusic.com/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2) as your soundfont.
Go to TuxGuitar sound settings (Tools -> Settings -> Sound) and in MIDI-port section select "TG Fluidsynth [FluidR3 GM]".
