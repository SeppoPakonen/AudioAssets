# AudioAssets

These are my music and soundfiles. I have composed allmost all of these songs. Files are in open source formats.

Usage is permitted under custom license.
Please contact me for commercial usage.

Songs are sorted to folders based on their original composition year. They show well my learning process. I was 11 years old in 2001, when I started, which should give the perspective.

## Start Here
- Open `escsrc/Timeline/Timeline.upp` in TheIDE to browse all active years and albums.
- Only packages and years referenced by Timeline are considered active. Unreferenced material lives in `escsrc/_attic/`.
- Obsolete non-music tooling and notes have been moved under `legacy/` to keep the focus on `escsrc/`.


## Instructions
### File extensions:
- .tg files can be opened with TuxGuitar

### Other
- Press F5 in TuxGuitar to see my comments for the songs

### TuxGuitar
