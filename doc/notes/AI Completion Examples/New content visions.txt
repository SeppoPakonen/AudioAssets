This female singer has a very naughty and wild imagination. He doesn't avoid dirty and lewd words, he enjoys them

A female singer has following content visions for songs:
- Sultry/Seductive: Wild and free: "You know I'm down with the dick. Baby I'm all that. Let me bang it out on this one night stand. We're vibing wet pussy, it was all over your face. Baby got the bomb ass pussy. Sexually knowing, wanna get freaky baby, ride that dick like a kawasaki."
- Nostalgic/sentimental: Struggle and triumph: "Baby's got a lot of baggage. Fuck it. You know the streets talk. Back in this muthafucka, I spark joints, we can get high. Said my hood like the damn zoo. I remember it well, never gave a fuck about the time, when ya young. And you say we were growing, had to find out the hard way."
- Spiritual/faithful: Fun and games: "What the fuck we are gonna do. Makes my toes curl. So silly, baby girl had to get her bills paid. I aint got a fucking limit. Everybody want world peace. Feeling like I'm Snoop. Make it juicy and spiritual like a joint get my weed."
- Hearbroken/lovesick: Seductive Intro: "He just wants to get in on this one special night. Got my finger on the trigger. Can't look him in his eye. Turn up the music to drown out the pain."
