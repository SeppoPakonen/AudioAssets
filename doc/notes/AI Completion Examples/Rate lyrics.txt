lyrics:
Verse 1:
Her online follower will share and press the like button
She is a social queen, a likeable machine
No skeletons in her closet, no more trolls chaotic
She'll post her pic again, will numbers increase then?

Chorus:
You come to my page
You captivate my soul
You come to my page
and you get me to follow.

Verse 2:
Provocative she is, also, often quite average
and sometimes dangerous, might survive all the stunts
Like in the beginning, she will always be clickbaiting
She can be gloomy too, my parasocial boo

Yeah, your pose in photos is the best of its kind to really please us all men
