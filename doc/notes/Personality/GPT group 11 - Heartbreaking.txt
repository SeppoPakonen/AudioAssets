		No, sun won't so long time nomore shine
		days get dark and sun just ain't so bright
		when snow comes ground then will be white
		and that is just alright.
		O'm gettin cold, so do you do.
		I want get back to warm but I can't move
		Can I be here near to you?
		I think it's just alright
		Why won't you now calm down
		Can I be near to you? I'm trembling and I feel cold too,
		Hey you can keep hating, but I won't make a sound or two.
		Will warmness ever come here true?
		Can sitting here bring closer us?

		I have a thousand tricks:
		one out of hundred works, one out of thousand wins,
		and not everything can be revealed,
		you must be given the opportunity to try.
		A brat living in a pillow
		doesn't know about the symptoms when the dog picks up the bone.
		I went to the bottom, cut my braid and went to work,
		but there are no further instructions.
		I know how to carry on.
		I have fooled you so many times that there is something to do.
		I copied your pain and I won't die.
		I'll take you to my place, I'll take you to my place.

		she isn't naughty and she isn't in parties and how bad it must feel.
		My girlfriend had done many things, had caught with drinks, had caught by weed,
		and now she can't be all by herself and must be that teen, that teen of this poem.
