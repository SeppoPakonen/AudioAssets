## Background
This song is about the power and emotion that comes from playing an electric guitar. It is about the feeling of being connected to the instrument and allowing it to speak through the music. It is about the soul of the electric guitar and the way it can move people through its sound.

### Project name: Guitar Soul

I didn't play guitar, when I made this originally. This is the first song where I expressed curiosity towards guitar playing.

I actually did have DJ equipments when I made this; dual vinyl turntables and mixer. The mp3 version has all sorts of scratching effects...


### 11.7.2022
I tried to modernize the original song. The name of this song was long "zippaduppa", but I changed it to "guitar soul". I remember very well, that the idea of the song was to go from generic Propellerheads Reason electronic song to "that rock what you hear from radio".



## Inspiration
- First curiosity toward guitar playing; from electronic demo to “radio rock” feel. Personifies the instrument’s age and voice.

## Lyrics (FI)
```
[Intro]
Hei jee ahaa haa
Wouu-uu-jei-jee-ee
Aa

[Verse 1]
Silmään taas osuu hän
Virittään kutsuu itseään
Mä pölyn pyyhin päält mun kitaran
Kieletkin vaihdan taas
Ja niin hän löytää äänen

[Pre-chorus]
Uudestaan mua muistuttaen

[Chorus]
Et kitara on sielukas
Siin rujo pinta on mut viel soimas
Ikä vain häntä parantaa
Kumpa voisin kuulla sen tarinat vanhat

[Instrumental]
Wou-woo-uu

[Verse 2]
Soittaja löytää kotiinsa
Vaik ulkonäölt on nyt vakava
Sun soittotyylikin voi muuttua
Sen saundi on sama
Ja niin hän soittaa laulut

[Pre-chorus]
Uusimmat nuorien

[Chorus]
Kitara on sielukas
Siin rujo pinta on mut viel soimas
Ikä vain häntä parantaa
Kumpa voisin kuulla sen tarinat vanhat

[Instrumental]
Wou-uu wo-u-woo-oo-oo

[Bridge]
Jee-ee
Ahaaa mm-mm
Kuule soundi mun kitaran
Kuule kuinka se soi

[Chorus]
Kitara on sielukas
Siin rujo pinta on mut viel soimas
Ikä vain häntä parantaa
Kumpa voisin kuulla sen tarinat vanhat

[Outro]
Sil on sielu
Joka laulaa
Joka muistaa
Aina
```

## Lyrics (EN)
```
[Intro]
Hey yeah ahaa haa
Wouu-uu-yeah-yeah-ee
Aa

[Verse 1]
My eyes once again see her
She calls the song within my hand
I brush the dust away from my old strings
Change them, they shine again
And so the voice is living

[Pre-chorus]
Once again it speaks to me

[Chorus]
This guitar’s a soul of fire
Her weathered skin still sings with power
Time has only made her strong
Wish I heard the stories of old she carries

[Instrumental]
Wou-woo-uu

[Verse 2]
The player finds his home in it
Though age has carved a sterner face
My style of playing too may change
But still the heart’s the same
And so it tells the anthem

[Pre-chorus]
Newest songs of younger hands

[Chorus]
This guitar’s a soul of fire
Her weathered skin still sings with power
Time has only made her strong
Wish I heard the stories of old she carries

[Instrumental]
Wou-uu wo-u-woo-oo-oo

[Bridge]
Yeah-ee
Ahaaa mm-mm
Hear the freedom in my song
Hear the anthem it plays

[Chorus]
This guitar’s a soul of fire
Her weathered skin still sings with power
Time has only made her strong
Wish I heard the stories of old she carries

[Outro]
It has spirit
It keeps singing
It remembers
Always
