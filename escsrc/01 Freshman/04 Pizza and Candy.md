## Background
The meaning of this song is that life is too short to rush through it. Instead, it is important to take a step back, reflect, and savor the moments that are experienced. It is important to let go of the everyday stress and live in the present moment. This song encourages listeners to take a break, appreciate the little things, and find peace in taking life slowly.

### Project name: Relaxed

This is one of the earliest surviving song, which I have made alone independently.  You can hear that it has the very safe bet for chord progression.

This was made with Fruity Loops originally. I remember other songs too what I made in my first period, and this really wasn't one of the firsts 5 or 10, but those were really bad I and knew it already back then. This one might have been the first tolerable song. I remember that I got frustrated with actual first songs, because they didn't resemble any of the songs that I heard in radio. I deleted them certainly.

Allmost none of the first 5-10 songs had chord progression and I had to ask help from my friend for that, because the first song, which we made together, had that. I probably did this after I asked help.

I still have old mp3 file for this song and I can't kinda believe I made it in 2002, but it certainly belongs to that time period chronologically and it also has the same sampled drums that we recorded in 2001 with some simple PC boom mic.

Original name is literally "rento", which means relaxed or chill or cool.

[Intro]
Aa-aa m-mm jee-ea-a

[Verse 1]
Joskus masis painaa
Turhaudun etten jaksa
Mut sitten tulee päivä
Et on taas pilvetöntä
Ei oo se varma lääke
Mut tuun mä hyväl päälle
Vielä jaksan vähän
Meen ulos herkkui syömään

[Pre-chorus]
Aurinko lämmin mut kaupalle vie
Ja kohta oon vihdoinkin siellä
Siel missä

[Chorus]
Pitsaa ja karkkia saan
Mansikkapirtelö mieles on vaan
Taas jaksaa

[Verse 2]
Samaa päiväst toiseen
En melkeen mistään poikkee
Ja rata tää on huono
Ikävii nuo muut on
Mut onneks kahvihetki
Mehu sekä keksi
Saa mielen paremmaksi
Myös kun meit on kaksi

[Pre-chorus]
Kaupunkiin ihmisten keskelle meen
Ja ruoka on mieles myös siellä
Siel missä

[Chorus]
Pitsaa ja karkkia saan
Mansikkapirtelö mieles on vaan
Taas jaksaa ku
Pitsaa ja karkkia saan
Mansikkapirtelö mieles on vaan
Taas jaksaa

[Bridge]
Näin
Mennä eteenpäin
Nyt ehkä vielä selvitään
Nyt kun on voinut olla tääl
Tääl missä

[Chorus]
Pitsaa ja karkkia saan
Mansikkapirtelö mieles on vaan
Taas jaksaa ku
Pitsaa ja karkkia saan
Mansikkapirtelö mieles on vaan
Taas jaksaa

[Outro]
Pitsaa ja karkkia 
Pitsaa ja karkkia 
Pitsaa ja karkkia vaan

## Lyrics (EN)
```
[Verse 1]
Sometimes sunshine can’t stay
Frustrate I wait, it’s grey
But then again a new day
Clouds gone they’re drawn away
No cure for sure to heal me
Still pure good cheer will feel me
I last at last I smile
Step out no doubt, worthile

[Prechorus 1]
Bright sun night done, I’m near to the store
Soon there noon air, I’ll need nothing more
There where

[Chorus]
Pizza sweet’s-a delight
Strawberry dairy is stuck in my sight
Feels right

[Verse 2]
Same track laid back, it’s slow
No change so strange, I know
This road unloads no good
Those friends dead ends, no good
But break I take, it’s golden
Cupcake milkshake, I’m holdin’
Mind clears kind cheers, I’m lighter
Two here true dear, feels

[Prechorus 2]
Town lights sound bright, with people I roam
Food there mood fair, I’m never alone
There where

[Chorus]
Pizza sweet’s-a delight
Strawberry dairy is stuck in my sight
Feels right, when
Pizza sweet’s-a delight
Strawberry dairy is stuck in my sight
Feels right

[Bridge]
Go on flow strong, I try
Move fast outlast, get by
Now here no fear, I dwell
This place warm face, all’s well
Here where

[Chorus]
Pizza sweet’s-a delight
Strawberry dairy is stuck in my sight
Feels right, when
Pizza sweet’s-a delight
Strawberry dairy is stuck in my sight
Feels right

[Outro]
Pizza and candy yeah
Pizza and candy yeah
Pizza and candy yeah
