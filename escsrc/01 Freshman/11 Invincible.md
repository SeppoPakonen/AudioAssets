## Background/Notes

ORIGINAL LYRICS FROM 2006.
ALSO IN FINNISH ALBUM

Background:
Originally played by my band The Vice
The original name of this song was "The Battle", but my friend Milja Björn liked this song and she made lyrics for this song with the title "Feels like home". I think those lyrics have been forgotten now.
I made this at the time when I was learning to play the guitar. This was something that I wanted to learn to play next. I could do only some chords and simple melodies.
Also, this was made shortly after I hiked for the first time in Finnish Lapland. That was 1 week long trip with my class (I'm was in Walforf school). It was fun and exhausting at the same time, which I think gave the feeling for this song.
Refurbished: 31.7.2022

Title: Girlfriend from Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I've been approaching, closing in like a cat
And I strike when you least expect that
I'm hunting you down, love is war, have no doubt
But in our love I can't be too much bound

[Chorus]
Victory, victory for me

[Verse 2]
Beauty I'm rich, surely that hated bitch
But the men want me down one by one
They want queen of the club, they get one with one but
I'm the master and you'll be my slave

[Chorus]
Victory, victory for me, invincible
I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse

[Bridge]
After your turn, you won't get more from this girl
Only once in this world I'm offered
They queue to me when again I am free
Always someone is waiting for me

[Guitar Solo]
Oh my God, it didn't go
And now my make up leaks

[Chorus]
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, invincible
