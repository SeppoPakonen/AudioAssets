[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I've been approaching, closing in like a cat
And I strike when you least expect that
I'm hunting you down, love is war, have no doubt
But in our love I can't be too much bound
[Chorus]
Victory, victory for me

[Verse 2]
Beauty I'm rich, surely that hated bitch
But the men want me down one by one
They want queen of the club, they get one with one but
I'm the master and you'll be my slave

[Chorus]
Victory, victory for me, invincible
I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse

[Bridge]
After your turn, you won't get more from this girl
Only once in this world I'm offered
They queue to me when again I am free
Always someone is waiting for me
[Guitar Solo]
Oh my God, it didn't go
And now my make up leaks

[Chorus]
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, I'm invincible, I'm gonna win them all, I'm gonna get what I want
Invincible, miss invincible, if I do want you, you don't wanna refuse
Invincible, invincible
