## Background
I was proud of this song when I made it.
I thought that it had a touching melody. As usual, I couldn't figure out what to say in lyrics, so I left that part undone. I just had an idea about some sort of escape. It had to be combination of physical and mental escape.

Lyrics made based on original idea 13.6.2021
These lyrics weren't used after all, because I didn't want to sign into these lyrics artistically.

### Notes: Heist/romance metaphor, short-form hook
- Originally conceived as an “escape” feeling; later lyrics drafted 2021 but not artistically adopted.
- Melancholic mid‑tempo pop-rock/EDM crossover; verse-first hook designed for 2‑second capture.

## Lyrics (FI)
Title: Sydämen varas
```
[Verse 1]
Varastin sydämes kuin karkin hyllyltä 
Mä piilotan kasvoni varjoilta tylyiltä
Mun sydän pomppii pelosta ja halusta
Tajuan et sä oot mun tärkein ryöstö onnistuva

[Chorus]
Nyt juoksen pois, mut sydämesi saan
En aijo antautuu, kun ajat mua takaa
Näytit et saa roisto rakastaa
Sun sylis varastaa, olla kuin kotonaan 

[Verse 2]
Yös pimeässä askeleeni kaikuvat
Hengitys huuruava on liike ainoa 
Sua etsin yössä sydämien jemmasta
Jokainen askel on merkki rikoksesta

[Chorus]
Nyt juoksen pois, mut sydämesi saan
En aijo antautuu, kun ajat mua takaa
Näytit et saa roisto rakastaa
Sun sylis varastaa, olla kuin kotonaan
```

## Lyrics (EN)
Title: Thief of the Heart
```
[Verse 1]
Soft swipe your heart like candy off the shelf
Shy, I shade my face from stern, salty stealth
Heart hoppin’, half scared and half hot for you
I clock it: you’re my sweetest heist, my win come true

[Chorus]
Now I jet, but still your heartbeat’s mine
I ain’t gonna fold while you chase my line
You showed a crook can kinda care, for real
Your cuddle I steal to feel like home—so chill

[Verse 2]
Night’s pitch-black, my steps snap back and ring
Breath fogs; this hush rush is the only thing
I hunt you, low-key, in heart’s stash hide-and-seek
Each step’s a sign—my tiny crime, soft-sweet and meek

[Chorus]
Now I jet, but still your heartbeat’s mine
I ain’t gonna fold while you chase my line
You showed a crook can kinda care, for real
Your cuddle I steal to feel like home—so chill
```
