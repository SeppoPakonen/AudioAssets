## Background

We played this song with the band called The Vice. I played my first gig with that band in spring 2006. This song was played in that gig. The gig was in the centre of the Oulu in a old wooden building next to the movie theather.

The original lyrics were not great. They were in non-fluent English. I also tried to please others with them, so they were a double-failure. They weren't to my own taste.

Hindsight 2005 this had way too artsy intro, and the effort to please others instead ourselves was doomed to failure.

The most positive thing in this song is the fact, that my 2nd band "worked" and "we shipped the product in time" in the sense, that we practiced this song for the first gig and we played the gig. That was a very solid run for a couple of teenagers, where no-one had any knowledge of managing that kind of process, and where no-one had prior experience of performing with a band.


## Style
A rock song with a melancholic yet energetic feel, featuring a female vocalist, The song is in a minor key, likely A minor, and maintains a moderate tempo throughout, The instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums, The acoustic guitar provides a consistent arpeggiated chord progression, while the electric guitar offers melodic fills and a distorted solo, The bass guitar provides a solid rhythmic and harmonic foundation, The drums maintain a steady rock beat with occasional fills, The female vocals are clean and clear, with a slightly melancholic tone, Production elements include reverb on the vocals and guitars, giving the song a spacious feel, The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental break and a guitar solo


## Lyrics (EN, original 2006)
Title: Great Escape

```
[Instrumental]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Once we had a night and we spent it together
Once we were friends, or I just thought so
And once you wanted me back at any price, yeah, at any price
You were like a cat with me, catching a fool
Caught me in a trap, but I didn't want you
Please let me go now, we'll meet then soon
I will give you a call, I will, believe me

[Chorus]
I'm planning my great escape, hiding all my traces
I have no reason here to stay
I'm planning my great escape, wanna get away
'Cause you make me feel this way

[Verse 2]
We're eating a breakfast with you next to me
Why am I here when I don't feel like it
I'm guilty in your prison, but walking free
Still locked to you
This mistake can't stay with me 'til end of my life
Hey, we have no more common than big need for love
Do you wanna go with me, go through it all
I'm sorry about that only for me

[Chorus]
I'm planning my great escape, hiding all my traces
I've no reason here to stay
I'm planning my great escape, wanna get away
'Cause you make me feel this way

[Instrumental]
(Hey, you should know that)
(I'll take my stuff and go)
(Never coming back to home)
(Tomorrow I'll be gone)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm making my great escape, taking my own way
I've no reason there to stay
I'm making my great escape, hiding all my traces
And you made me feel this way
I'm making my great escape, taking my own way
I've no reason there to stay
I'm making my great escape, hiding all my traces
And you made me feel this way (ooh-ooh-ooh)
```

Title: Great Escape (Steve Chill remix)

```
[Instrumental]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Had that one wild night, we crashed out together
Thought we were friends, or maybe I just was
And you wanted me back for any price, yeah, like any price, too
You played real sneaky with me, baiting a fool
Caught me in your trap, but I didn't want you
Please let me dip now, we'll link up soon
I will hit up your phone, I will, believe me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm plotting my great escape, hiding all my traces
I got no reason here to stay
I'm plotting my great escape, wanna get away
'Cause you make me feel this way

[Verse 2]
We eating our breakfast with you next to me
Why am I here when I don't vibe with it
I'm guilty in your prison, still walking free
Still chained to you
This big L can't stay with me till end of my life
Hey, we share nothing more than a big need for love
Do you wanna roll with me, go through it all
I'm sorry that it's really just for me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm plotting my great escape, hiding all my traces
Got no reason here to stay
I'm plotting my great escape, wanna get away
'Cause you make me feel this way

[Instrumental]
(Hey, you should know fr)
(I'll grab my stuff and go)
(Never coming back home, no)
(Tomorrow I'll be gone)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm making my great escape, taking my own lane
Got no reason there to stay
I'm making my great escape, hiding all my traces
And you made me feel this way
I'm making my great escape, taking my own lane
Got no reason there to stay
I'm making my great escape, hiding all my traces
And you made me feel this way (ooh-ooh-ooh)
