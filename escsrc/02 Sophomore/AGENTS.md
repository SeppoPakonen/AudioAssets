# Sophomore

Album number 2. Year 2005.

Scope
- 2005 material curated in 2020-2025. Album 02 is published in both FI and EN; treat lyrics as final (not drafts).

Content Notes (from .txt)
- Themes: budding romance and pursuit (Let’s Go Somewhere Just Me And You), sensual tension/power dynamics (Cougar), nostalgia and late-night reflection (Mornings), desire vs restraint.
- Structure: verse/chorus with occasional duet perspectives; FI primary with published EN translations.
- Archives: `ENG archive.txt` / `FIN archive.txt` present; keep FI/EN parity and note AI-assisted translations where used.

Psychological Notes (light)
- Approach–avoidance: attraction paired with fear of rejection or getting “too far gone”.
- Idealization vs realism: adolescent bravado set against vulnerability and uncertainty.
- Emerging empathy: increasing perspective-taking between partners in duet structures.

Conventions
- Convert `.txt` → `.md` with Prom-era sections (Inspiration, Structure with syllable counts, Lyrics FI/EN, Production notes).
- Keep `.upp` year separators intact; if `.tg` files carry old project names, rename to official English titles and update `.upp`.
- Place `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first in the `.upp` file list when present.

Next Actions
- Convert duet/alternating-voice songs first (clear sectioning); mark speaker labels.
- If any side (FI/EN) is missing in-repo, backfill from published release sources instead of labeling drafts.
- Prep consistent cover image asset for 02.
