Truth or Dare

[Verse 1, male]
You are so lovely
Quite better than me
We could play-pretend
Truths, dares to the end

[Verse 1, female]
But not bare truth, no
Dance, don’t cringe so low
Start, sweetheart, to kiss
Who dares risk this?

[Chorus, anyone]
With tongue now
Mm, Your tongue I long to tantalize
Mm, Your mouth I’m bound to socialize
Mm, I heat, we’re heating, blazing bright
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight

[Post-Chorus, both]
Truth or dare—this is it
Truth or dare—this is it
Truth or dare—this is it
Truth or dare—this is it

[Verse 3, male]
You are so divine
You trace along mine
We slow, take our care
Skip, flip the dare

[Verse 4, female]
But not plain truth, dear
Kiss, kiss back right here
All want in this play
Whose turn today?

[Chorus, anyone]
With tongue now
Mm, Your tongue I long to tantalize
Mm, Your mouth I’m bound to socialize
Mm, I heat, we’re heating, blazing bright
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight

[Bridge, male]
We’ve got three minutes
Settle, be in it
Touch you—yes, you know
Hand, face, soft and slow

[Bridge, female]
Your scent springs surprise
New friend, new sunrise
No drinks here, we’re clear
Easy, oh my dear

[Bridge, both]
Your taste just tastes so good, so good
Yeah, your taste just tastes so good, so good
Your taste just tastes so good, so good
Yeah, your taste just tastes so good, so good

[Chorus, anyone]
With tongue now
Mm, Your tongue I long to tantalize
Mm, Your mouth I’m bound to socialize
Mm, I heat, we’re heating, blazing bright
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight

[Outro, both]
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight
Though we don’t share the same tongue tonight
No, we don’t share the same tongue tonight
