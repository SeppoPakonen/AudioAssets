Title: Tahdon sut

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1, male singing]
Meidän deitti ei menny putkeen
Sanat hukkui tilaisuuden tullen
Kun mä uskaltanut en
 
[Verse 2, female singing]
Mä oon tuntenut sut kauan
Mutten voi soittaa kuitenkaan
Kun sua mietin aamulla

[Prechorus 1, male singing]
Kai sä tykkäät musta tarpeeksi
Kai mä voisin tehdä kaikkeni

[Prechorus 2, female singing]
Vain sun kanssa mä haluun olla nyt
Ootan että sä syyttä viivyt

[Prechorus 3, duet singing]
Nähdäänkö (aa-aa-aa)
Taas tänään
Tee jo aloite

[Chorus, duet singing]
Tahdon sut tänään tänne
Tahdon sut pidemmälle
Suutele mua vihdoin ekan kerran
Tahdon sut sängys haliin
Tanssimaan huulilla niin
Että sanat unohtaa jo voi
Oi niinpä ois

[Instrumental]
(na-na-na-na)

[Verse 3, female singing]
Sä yrität jotain uudestaan
Hyvä että et lähe karkaamaan
Vaikka vähän turhauttaa

[Verse 4, male singing]
Sä annat mun olla puikoissa
Mut tykkäätköhän sä suukoista
Myös niistä ranskalaisista

[Prechorus 1, female singing]
Kai sä vihdoin tajuut jotakin
Ku sä hiljaa silmiin katselit

[Prechorus 2, male singing]
Tuntuu että valmiiks oot jo mun
Nyt vain puuttuu varmistus kun

[Prechorus 3, duet singing]
Suudellaan
Vihdoinkin
Kumpi aloittaa

[Chorus, duet singing]
Tahdon sut tänään tänne
Tahdon sut pidemmälle
Suutele mua vihdoin ekan kerran
Tahdon sut sängys haliin
Tanssimaan huulilla niin
Että sanat unohtaa jo voi
Oi niinpä ois

[Bridge, female singing]]
Milloin sä suutelet mua niin
et lentää pois sukatkin
Mä vain tahtoisin tuntea lähempää
Sun vahvoja käsiäs
Sängys pyörien mietin
Kun vetäisit lähemmäksi
Ei epäselvää
Et miten täst edetään
Ei mitään muttaa
Vain pelkkää ihanuutta
Sä rutistaisit mut
Halauksin

[Chorus, duet singing]
Tahdon sut tänään tänne
Tahdon sut pidemmälle
Suutele mua vihdoin ekan kerran
Tahdon sut sängys haliin
Tanssimaan huulilla niin
Että sanat unohtaa jo voi
Oi niinpä ois

Video idea:
A young man and a young woman are dating and don't get to have their first kiss. In between, we see them both separately in bed, thinking. Towards the end, a kiss occurs. At the end, the couple lies in bed together.


<<<<
Theme: Nordic EDM-Pop Romance
Color Palette:
• Soft pastel blues and pinks (early scenes)
• Cool, desaturated midnight blues (thinking-alone montages)
• Warm, gentle golds and rose tones (first-kiss and “lying together” finale)

Camera & Lenses:
• Digital cinema (Arri Alexa Mini or RED)
• 35 mm prime for natural skin tones and shallow DOF
• Stabilized gimbal for smooth, intimate tracking
• Occasional handheld for nervous, candid moments

Lighting:
• Soft, window-light simulations (diffused key + subtle fill)
• Practical accents: bedside lamps, fairy lights, neon bar signs
• Post-kiss glow: low-intensity warm backlight to heighten intimacy

Editing & Pacing:
• Sync cuts to beat (110–120 BPM moderate tempo)
• Verse: slower cuts, allow moments to breathe
• Pre-chorus: accelerating cuts and subtle cross-dissolves
• Chorus: punchy, rhythmic cuts; occasional slow-mo on impact words (“ekana kerran,” “sängys haliin”)
• Transition to bedtime scenes: soft fade or light-leak wipe

Visual Effects & Graphics:
• Kinetic lyric overlays in clean, geometric sans serif
• Lyrics appear word-by-word on key vocal lines; gentle pop-in/out on the beat
• Light leaks, soft film grain (~8–12 ISO), slight chromatic edge fringing
• Moment of first kiss: brief bloom glow and pastel color flare

Overall Vibe:
– Intimate, hopeful romance with Scandinavian coolness melting into warm tenderness at the kiss.
– Rhythmic editing and lyric motion graphics that reflect the clear, melodic male & female vocals with spoken-word flourishes.
