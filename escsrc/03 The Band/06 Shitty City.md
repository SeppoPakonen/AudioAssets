# Shitty City (Paska kaupunni)

## Background
Some effort to do band-friendly music. Doesn't sound too good. The high vocal pitch doesn't do it.

We considered playing this for "The Vice" band, but it didn't interest us.

Not really a personal song. The "paska kaupunni" or "shitty city" is a local phenomenon, which I must cash into.


## Style: Sensed
A high-energy punk rock track with a driving rhythm section and raw, aggressive vocals,
The instrumentation features distorted electric guitars, a prominent bass guitar, and a powerful drum kit,
The tempo is slow with fast drum fills, around 80 BPM, with a consistent driving feel,
The key is A minor,
The song structure is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro,
The lead vocals are male, delivered with a shouting, almost spoken-word quality in the verses, transitioning to a more melodic but still aggressive delivery in the chorus,
The guitar riffs are simple but effective, characterized by power chords and a slightly dissonant edge,
The bass provides a strong, rhythmic foundation, often mirroring the guitar lines,
The drums feature a driving beat with frequent snare drum accents and cymbal crashes,
Production-wise, the mix is raw and unpolished, emphasizing the guitars and drums,
There is a noticeable amount of distortion on the guitars and a slight reverb on the vocals,
The overall sound is loud and in-your-face, typical of punk rock,
There are no complex chord progressions, relying primarily on I-V-VI-IV progressions in the verses and choruses,
The melody is largely vocal-driven, with the instruments providing a rhythmic and harmonic backdrop

## Style: Fine-tuned
A slow punk rock track with raw, aggressive vocals,
The instrumentation features distorted electric guitars, a prominent bass guitar, and a powerful drum kit,
The drums plays slow rhythm with fast fills,
The song structure is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro,
The lead vocals are male, delivered with a shouting, almost spoken-word quality in the verses, transitioning to a more melodic but still aggressive delivery in the chorus,
The guitar riffs are simple but effective, characterized by power chords and a slightly dissonant edge,
The bass provides a strong, rhythmic foundation, often mirroring the guitar lines,
The drums feature a driving beat with frequent snare drum accents and cymbal crashes,
Production-wise, the mix is raw but balanced,
There is a noticeable amount of distortion on the guitars and a slight reverb on ocals,
The overall sound is loud and in-your-face, typical of punk rock,
The melody is largely vocal-driven, with the instruments providing a rhythmic and harmonic backdrop


## Lyrics (FI)

Title: Paska kaupunni

```
[Verse 1]
En mä tykkää jäädä
Tahdon pois täältä
Kylmää ja oon jäässä
Joka säässä
Ihmiset on saastaa
Harhaista paskaa
Ylpeää roskaa
Täysin turhaa

[Prechorus 1]
Vain pelkkää pahuutta
puolustaa kuolemaan asti
Ei mitään tarkista
Uskoo kun sanotaan

[Chorus]
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni

[Verse 2]
Kuplaa ei saa särkee
Muijal paskan tärkeel
Pankki pääsi ääneen
Köyhäl järjel
Ota myrkkypiikki
Ylpeys niinku nistil
Haluu ne mut listii
Pystyis vissiin

[Prechorus 2]
Vain omaa etua ajetaan
Kiusataan

[Chorus]
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni

[Verse 3]
Valhetta vaa myyään
Syntipukkii syyttää
Terveyskin sun viiään
Ei oo töitä
Kaikki ne lavastaa
Jotka voi valittaa
Yksin unohdetaan
Kunnes kuollaan

[Prechorus 3]
Nii vitun vaikiaa
On olla vaan kotona
Ja taas viilentää hermoja
Kunnes saa unohtaa et

[Chorus]
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni10000-166741,67
Tää vaa on nii paska kaupunni

[Outro]
Paska kaupunki
Paska kaupunki
Paska kaupunki
Nii vitun paska kaupunki
Painu helvettiin
Lähe pois jo
Painu helvettiin
Vitun kusipää
```



## Lyrics (EN)

Title: Shitty City

```
[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna stay, I gotta get away
It’s ice cold all day, In every kinda day
People here are scum, Twisted, raving scum
Proud, parading scum, All of it is scum

[Prechorus 1]
Nothing but pure hate
They’ll ride it to the grave
They never check a thing
They just believe what’s said

[Chorus]
This is just a shitty city
This is just a shitty city

[Verse 2]
Don’t you break the bubble, Their crap is prized-up trouble
The bank got all its say, The poor got pushed away
Take a toxic pill, Pride like a junkie still
They wanna get me killed, Guess they probably will

[Prechorus 2]
Only their own gain they chase
Grinding in your face

[Chorus]
This is just a shitty city
This is just a shitty city

[Verse 3]
Nothing but lies they sell
Blame the scapegoat—yell
They’ll steal your health as well
No jobs— it’s all a shell
Those who could raise hell
Left alone to dwell
Till we die as well

[Prechorus 3]
So fucking hard—alone
Just staying stuck at home
Cooling my nerves and tone
Till I forget—alone

[Chorus]
This is just a shitty city
This is just a shitty city

[Outro]
Shitty city
Shitty city
Shitty city
So fucking shitty city
Go to hell
Go away as well
Go to hell
Fucking asshole
```
