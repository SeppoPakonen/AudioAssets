## Background
Project name: 70s vibe

I've tried to finish this song since the first version. I had come back and back again to try to find chord progressian and structural parts. This song was musically  a difficult nut to crack. It took 16 years to finish this, which is pretty messed up, to be honest...

- Original composition: 14.8.2006
- Finished composition: 7.6.2022
- Finished lyrics: 8.6.2022

Lyrics are just yet another nonsensical take on relaxing evening with boozes and people.


## Style
A high-energy big band rock piece with a driving beat and prominent synth melodies,
The song is in a minor key, creating a slightly melancholic yet determined atmosphere,
The tempo is moderately fast,
The instrumentation includes a powerful drum player providing a consistent four-on-the-floor beat,
a deep bass synth laying down the harmonic foundation, and multiple layers of melodic synthesizers,
One brass plays a prominent arpeggiated melody, while others provide pads and counter-melodies,
The male lead vocal is clean and clear, delivered with a passionate and slightly melancholic tone,
The vocal melody is largely syllabic, following the instrument melodies,
The song structure is verse-chorus, with instrumental breaks that feature evolving synth textures,
Production elements include a clear mix with good separation between instruments,
and a moderate amount of reverb on the vocals and some synths, giving a sense of space,
The overall sound is polished and modern orchestral rock


## Lyrics (FI)
Title: Avaruuteen

```
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Jos mä en saa, niin ei tarvita
makeutta ja lämpöä taas, niinku lomalla
Mielessä on vain tää ilta, kun
mä aukaisen
kylmän ja ohraisen oluen, uuden

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Valmistajaa me ei tarvita
katselemaan, kuinka me taas
vähän nautitaan.
Toiveita en mä voi paljastaa.
Se vie taijan.
Ehkä voi tapahtuu kaikki uus ja muu.

[Bridge]
Sä oot taas juuri siinä.
Sä voit kuulla kun mä
viel sulle kerron rakkauden,
ehkä pidän kädest uudelleen

[Bridge]
Katsees vie avaruuteen
ja tartun sun taajuuteen

[Instrumental]
```



## Lyrics (FI)
Title: Into Space

```
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
If I can’t have, then we don’t need
sweetness or heat—on repeat, like a holiday.
My mind’s on only this night, when
I crack and spin
open a cold, malt-gold beer, brand-new.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
No maker’s mark we really need
watching us watch how we again
sip and savor.
Wishes I can’t just say or share;
that kills the flair.
Maybe the new and true can all come through.

[Instrumental]

You’re right back right there.
You can hear when I

[Chorus]
still tell you of love again,
maybe I’ll hold your hand again.

[Instrumental]
Your look pulls me into space,
and I tune to your frequency.
```
