WORLD_BIBLE
- settings: European urban realism (tram stops, kiosks, sidewalks, post office lines, corner cafés, train stations)
- mood_of_world: indifferent, rushed, self-focused; socially transactional
- camera_behavior: observer perspective; often elevated or detached; society watches but doesn’t care
- social_friction: protagonist gives time/energy; world takes it without reciprocity or thanks

MOTION_LANGUAGE
- camera: begin on detail or partially obscured view, THEN reveal character; minimal face exposure
- shot_style: handheld, slightly imperfect, documentary; avoid cinematic smoothness
- depth_of_field: shallow for intimate detail shots (T2–T2.8), deeper for public wide shots (T4–T8)
- transitions: jump cuts & straight cuts only; avoid dissolves or aesthetic transitions

CONTENT_SAFETY
- tone: raw but dignified; punk is self-possession, not suffering
- no trauma imagery, no harassment scenes, no glamorizing struggle
- keep realism; avoid influencer aesthetics or staged activism

NEGATIVE_PROMPTS
- no beauty-filter look, no glossy skin, no commercial fashion lighting
- no neon trope punk, no cosplay punk, no spiky hair cliché
- no magical realism, no symbolic metaphors, no dream sequences
- no villains, no dramatic confrontations, no breakdown scenes
- avoid corporate stock-footage vibe; no sterile offices with fake actors
