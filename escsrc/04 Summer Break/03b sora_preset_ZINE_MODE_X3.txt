Title: "ZINE MODE X3 — Chaotic Xerox B-Roll" (Sora-preset)
Version: 1.0

# NOTE TO USER/EDITOR (not for model parsing)
# This preset intentionally breaks visual polish. Do not "clean it up".

RENDER_SPECS
- grain: maximum xerox noise + analog 35mm hybrid, intensity 0.75
- shutter: 180° natural motion blur, but jitter artifacts allowed
- camera_profile: photocopied analog zine aesthetic, 24–35mm equivalent
- lens_distortion: slight barrel + xerox ghosting edges, amount 0.05
- vignetting: heavy, uneven edges like copy machine burn, amount 0.25
- chromatic_aberration: chaotic, color-channel drift allowed
- stabilization: intentionally unstable; jump-cut + jitter encouraged
- max_duration: 15s per output recommended

GLOBAL_LOOK_AND_FEEL
- palette: full color preserved but warped; color bleeding + toner smears
- contrast: high contrast with crushed blacks + blown highlights in spots
- LUT: "Xerox-Punk-Color-Decay" (color warps, misregistration, harsh texture)
- atmosphere: photocopy haze, toner dust, paper fibers, digital compression artifacts
- lighting_priority: no beautification; harsh overhead or practical light only

WORLD_BIBLE
- setting: Nordic everyday urban (tram stops, kiosks, bus shelters, sidewalks, post boxes)
- mood_of_world: indifferent, transactional, mildly absurd
- camera_behavior: observer of objects, systems, environments, signage, motion — not people
- social_commentary: soft socio-political; critique implied through environment composition

MOTION_LANGUAGE
- camera: chaotic xerox motion; jump cuts, whip-pans, zooms, stutters
- shot_style: zine collage energy; fragments, inserts, textures, ephemera
- depth_of_field: inconsistent; accept focus breathing + misfocus as texture
- transitions: tape splices, abrupt cuts, photocopy glitch frames

SOUND_DESIGN
- texture: lo-fi noise collage — xerox machine hum, cassette hiss, faint tram rails screech
- avoid: clean field recordings or polished ambience

CONTENT_SAFETY
- no people in focus; if accidental, obscure or crop out faces
- no brand logos in full clarity; degrade via xerox texture or cropping

NEGATIVE_PROMPTS
- no influencers, no models, no "cinematic", no bokeh glam
- no smooth gimbal shots, no clean color grading
- no ad-like compositions, no inspirational typography
- no magical realism, no dream sequences, no character drama
