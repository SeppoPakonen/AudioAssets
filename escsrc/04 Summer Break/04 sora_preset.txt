ASH NEON HYPERREALISM — SORA PRESET

Visual Identity:
A cold, hyperreal visual world where faith, repression and futuristic autonomy coexist. The palette blends desaturated blues with subtle violet and ash‑neon glows. The imagery feels tactile, sharp, metallic and emotionally distant, as if observed through an unforgiving digital lens.

Lighting & Color:
• Dominant tones: cold blue, steel gray, ash neon, hints of violet.
• Hard, directional lighting with sharp reflections on metal and glossy surfaces.
• Neon glows are subtle pulses — not nightclub, but “sacred circuitry”.
• High contrast, minimal saturation, cold white balance.
• Surfaces reflect like glass, chrome or wet stone.

Atmosphere:
• Air feels still, almost sterilized.
• No visible dust or grain; clarity is unforgiving.
• Water or reflective surfaces appear as calm mirrors.
• Soundless reverence — a digital shrine frozen in time.

Camera & Composition:
• Slow, dreamlike camera glides — orbital, drifting, or creeping forward.
• Focus pulls shift meaning: surface ➜ reflection ➜ subject.
• Symmetry and geometry echo Islamic architecture, but abstracted into cyber‑minimalist forms.

Texture & Materials:
• Chrome, glass, carbon fiber, polished marble, reflective latex, neon circuitry.
• Skin tones remain natural but illuminated by cold light.
• Fabric of the veil feels fragile, slightly translucent.
• Futuristic clothing extremely shiny — almost liquid‑latex in reflectivity.

Emotional Tone:
• No redemption arc — only tension crystallized.
• Reverence without warmth; autonomy without triumph.
• A looped conflict between devotion and selfhood.
