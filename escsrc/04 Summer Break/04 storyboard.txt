STORYBOARD — ASH NEON HYPERREALISM (TikTok Loop)

Structure:
5 scenes interwoven to loop seamlessly. Each scene has A‑roll (human presence) + B‑roll (symbol / environment). Camera language is optimized for TikTok — intimate, hypnotic, with looping visual motifs.

Motifs: reflection, symmetry, water, neon pulse, veil ↔ hair, prayer pose ↔ power stance.

SCENE 1 — “The Veil of Silence”
A‑roll: Tight shot — veiled woman kneeling on cold marble floor. Camera slowly creeps forward. Light falls in a triangular shape. A micro‑zoom breath, as if the camera inhales.
B‑roll: Ornamental wall patterns in shadow, faint ash‑neon pulse through geometric lattice. Focus rack between wall texture and distant doorway.

SCENE 2 — “Cyber Skin, Sacred Steel”
A‑roll: Futuristic woman with blue hair, shiny black latex‑like clothing. Camera orbits at shoulder height, slow 270° arc. Light reflects in sharp streaks across outfit.
B‑roll: Metallic corridor with blue LED lines like digital prayer niches. Slow vertical pan from reflective floor to neon arch above.

SCENE 3 — “The Shadow Cleric”
A‑roll: A tall cloaked cleric (no face) stands behind translucent screen. We only see a silhouette. Camera slides sideways, as if spying.
B‑roll: Close on water bowl with ripples reflecting minaret‑like shapes; ripple loops perfectly for video looping.

SCENE 4 — “Duality Fracture”
A‑roll: Split‑frame style — reflection of veiled woman in a cracked mirror, but reflection shows the futuristic version. Camera micro‑tilts to enhance unease.
B‑roll: Abstract neon geometry on marble; slow pull‑back to reveal mosque‑inspired cyber architecture.

SCENE 5 — “Loop of Faith”
A‑roll: The futuristic woman removes her headpiece slowly, but before we see full expression, cut back to Scene 1 posture — creating a loop.
B‑roll: A reflective surface (glass / water / polished stone) fills frame; reflection flickers between veil and cyber‑self. Freeze on reflection → jump cuts seamlessly to Scene 1.

To Loop:
End frame matches Scene 1’s lighting shape and camera distance, allowing infinite scroll rewatches.

A slow-motion shot of the futuristic woman’s black latex sleeve brushing against a carved marble column, neon reflections bending across both surfaces.

Overhead shot of prayer rugs arranged in perfect symmetry, but one rug replaced by a metallic circuit-board textile, camera drifting downwards.

A corridor lined with translucent curtains that sway without wind; the veiled woman walks between them, each curtain showing a faint digital reflection of her alternate self.

Futuristic woman’s face in extreme close-up, tiny neon circuit patterns projected across her skin like a synthetic henna design.

A row of shoes outside a prayer space — all traditional except one pair: glossy cyber boots reflecting blue light, camera glides past at ground level.

Silhouette of the cleric framed by a neon-outlined arch, his shadow flickering as if corrupted by a glitch in reality.

Futuristic woman tracing a finger along Arabic calligraphy engraved into metal; as her finger moves, the engraving flickers into digital code.

Slow pan across traditional prayer beads lying beside a sleek data cable coiled the same way — visual echo of past and future devotion.

The veiled woman stands before a large reflective wall; her reflection lags slightly behind her movements, hyperreal uncanny motion delay.

Futuristic woman framed inside a geometric neon halo, camera gently pushes in while the halo slowly rotates like a digital mandala.

A glass of water placed on a prayer mat; ripples form without touch, reflecting neon arcs that slice the reflection into fragments.

The cleric turns a page of a blank book — the page emits a faint holographic script for a moment before fading.

Drone-like top shot of a circular prayer space, but lit with neon floor lines forming a circuit-like mandala; the two women appear opposite each other, unmoving.

A wall of small prayer niches, but inside each niche is a suspended reflective orb showing different versions of the women, camera gliding past.

The futuristic woman’s blue hair illuminated by scanning laser lines, revealing shifting Arabic calligraphy hidden within the strands.
