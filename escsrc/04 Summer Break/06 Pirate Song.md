# Pirate Song

## Background
We almost started a band with me, Iina, Riikka and Arttu. We seriously thought about learning this song together. I guess there weren't enough persistence in them, because the plan never actualized. Some memory-harming activites might have been involved. Riikka already had all band equipments in her large attic room, and we used to hang out and drink there. Fun times. We all were into mellow dub like band jams... My original version of this song was probably too energetic for that kind of vibes and that was totally my fault.

In conclusion, this is what we had in our minds, but what we never actualised.

## Style
A melancholic ska reggae piece with a slow tempo and a minor key, The instrumentation includes a clean electric guitar playing arpeggiated chords, a bass guitar providing a walking bass line, and drums with a simple, steady beat, The vocals are delivered in a low, almost spoken-word style, with a slightly melancholic tone, The song structure is verse-chorus with an instrumental break, The production is clean with a clear separation of instruments, The guitar features a subtle reverb and delay, and the bass is prominent in the mix, The drums are mixed to provide a solid rhythmic foundation without overpowering the other instruments, The overall mood is reflective and slightly somber

## Lyrics (EN)
Title: Mia

```
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Locked doors breathing
She frames her shadow with a steady hand
No bargain crowd, one gaze she chose to meet
A bauhaus line keeps tremor out of sight
She names the light alone

[Chorus 1]
No sale
This smile unlocks for vows, not coins or cheers
A china plate warms each night
We set it out, two places, measured
Not banners, not crowds at all
Your steady glance keeps ghosts from circling near
Old posters stay down in dust
We eat in peace each time

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Ledger balanced
She hung the prints in frames she chose herself
No father's gavel knocking in her chest
She learned the light, the angle, honest poise
Craft over noise each day

[Chorus 1]
No sale
This smile unlocks for vows, not coins or cheers
A china plate warms each night
We set it out, two places, measured
Not banners, not crowds at all
Your steady glance keeps ghosts from circling near
Old posters stay down in dust
We eat in peace each time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 2]
Keep the door blue lit
Keys softly turn
Plates hum like clocks at dusk
Two chairs, one beat in time
No crowd can buy this steady glow
Your gaze returns to right address
Lights stay agreed, dear
```
