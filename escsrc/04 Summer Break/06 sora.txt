🎬 30 SORA-PROMPTIA (5–8 sek per kuva)

Tämä on täsmärakennettu 3 min videolle — nopeat leikkaukset, kanavasurffaus, camp→noir→nirvana.

HUOM: Älä sisällytä minuuttilukuja Soraan, ne ovat sinulle ohjenuorana.
Tunnelma: yritysmaailman jargon kohtaa katujen kaaoksen, lyyrinen musta huumori, “valtio ei ole meidän puolella” -viba.

🟨 CAMP-ALUKKO (0:00–0:40) — 60’s Batman TV-estetiikka, yliannostus neonvitamiinia

Technicolor 1960s comic-book style bank exterior, Dutch angle, bold “BANKKI!” sign, exaggerated colors, playful heroic music vibe.

Inside bank: Miia in absurdly cheap disguise (eye mask, striped shirt), tip-toeing cartoonishly, giant “SNEAK!” text pops.

Miia slips on marble floor, flailing like slapstick mime, “WOOPS!” text bubble appears.

Camp security guard reading newspaper, oblivious, Miia steals bag of money painted with € symbol, “HEIST-TASTIC!” caption.

Exit doors jam, Miia comically shoulder-rams them, doors explode open with “WHAM!” comic burst.

Chase begins: Miia running in fast-motion like 60’s villain (in superhero story), background obviously a cheap painted backdrop of city.

📺 GLITCH CHANNEL SWITCH #1 — static, VHS tearing, 0.3s

Same chase but now gritty handheld street cam, dusk rain, realism creeping in. Sirens echo like dub delay.

Miia jumps over puddle but slips, lands in reggae-skank pose; a ska horn sound-effect visualized as comic notes.

*📺 GLITCH SWITCH #2 — TV flicker to police-propaganda channel

Overly patriotic police recruitment ad aesthetic: cops posing heroically, awkward smiles, text: “SERVE & OVER-CHARGE TAXPAYERS”.

🟦 PIDÄTYS & SELLIIN SIIRTYMINEN (0:40–1:20)

Police car interior, Miia in backseat, neon lights paint her face, she raises eyebrow deadpan at camera as if aware of viewers.

Stereotypical cop dramatically reads her rights from cue cards, but cards are upside-down.

Booking photo sequence like 60’s montage: Miia poses like a fashion shoot, quick cuts, silly props.

📺 GLITCH SWITCH #3 — CRT → Film Noir

Cold concrete cell, single bulb flicker, color now desaturated, bass-echo ripple visual motif begins.

Miia on yoga mat in lotus position, incense burning, prison bars behind; absurd serenity in depressing cell.

Vartija koputtaa kaltereihin, meditaatio keskeytyy “BONK!” caption, Miia stays emotionless like enlightened intern at bad startup.

⚖️ Oikeussalikanaali (1:20–1:50) — amerikkalainen farssi

Over-the-top US courtroom, giant flag, golden eagle, judge with cowboy hat and oversized gavel.

Jury of caricatures: influencer taking selfies, clown, corporate CEO wolf, confused grandma knitting.

Judge slams gavel, “ORDER!” pops like Batman fight caption; jury nods in synchronized robotic absurdity.

Miia tries to speak, but courtroom music swells overly dramatic, drowning her out — system as operatic farce.

📺 GLITCH SWITCH #4 — static→noir documentary tone

Close-up on Miia’s tired eyes; reflection of bars; audio visualized as heartbeat light pulse.

🧱 VANKILAN SYVYMMÄT KERROKSET (1:50–2:20) — dokumentaarinen + runollinen kurkistus

Wide shot: communal prison block, bleak lighting, cold hues, echoing footsteps.

Prisoners meditating in a circle awkwardly, as if corporate forced “mindfulness day”, Miia slightly levitating 1 cm.

Tears rolling down Miia’s cheek in slow motion, blending into rain dripping from ceiling — symbolic leakage of state empathy.

Graffiti of a door drawn on a wall, Miia traces it with finger, it briefly glitches like portal might become real.

🌈 VALAISTUMINEN (2:20–3:00) — Miia kieltäytyy olemasta signaali

📺 GLITCH SWITCH #5 — channels scroll rapidly: cooking show → news → teleshopping → static → blank

Miia sits center frame, cell dissolves into infinite TV screens showing her own life scenes looping.

She stands, touches screen; her hand passes through, pixels drift off like fireflies.

Prismatic colors replace concrete; Miia’s body turns semi-translucent, faint cosmic symbols appear around her.

Bars melt into rays of light; she steps through; her form becomes silhouette made of broadcast signal.

Miia floats in cosmic void mixed with 1960s comic dots, smiling genuinely for first time.

Screen fades to pure white; soft text appears: “MIIA HAS EXITED THE BROADCAST.” followed by faint dub echo.
