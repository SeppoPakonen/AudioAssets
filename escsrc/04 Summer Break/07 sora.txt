SORA PRESET: Minor-Key Grunge Studio Narrative

Camera & Motion:
- Slow, deliberate dolly and orbit moves
- Occasional handheld realism
- Frequent use of reflections in windows and glass
- Mostly medium and close shots for emotional realism

Color & Texture:
- Warm orange sunrise tones in the apartment
- Muted blues/greys in city and studio
- Soft film-like grain, low to medium contrast
- Realistic, slightly melancholic look

Characters:
- 8 men in the studio world:
  * 6 band members including the baritone vocalist
  * 2 studio staff in the control room
- Ordinary, realistic men, not stylized heroes
- Vocalist is the emotional focus: tired, gentle, quietly wounded

Ghost Woman Rule (CRITICAL):
- Female figure is only a memory or vision
- She must ALWAYS be between 0% and 50% opacity
- She is NEVER fully solid or physically present
- Appears only briefly and rarely
- Can show up as a faint, semi-transparent figure on the empty half of the bed, at the clean side of the kitchen table, or as a subtle reflection in studio glass
- Always partially transparent, easily missed, never the main subject of a shot

Mood & Themes:
- Realistic, melancholic, with understated dark humor
- Apartment: quiet single life, tragicomic absence of a woman
- Studio: “altar of comfort” for men, soft camaraderie and muted healing
- Core theme: he does not know how to be in a relationship and feels he “doesn’t really know anything,” but finds partial belonging in the band and studio.
