SORA PRESET: OULU 2006 NIGHTLESS RAVE

Camera: Fixed-facing, handheld documentary look. 28mm lens, distance 1–2 m from protagonist’s face. Her face remains stable while environment moves, blurs, and swirls. Light breathing motion.

Character: Finnish woman, 18–25, authentic 2006 Oulu style. Slightly messy makeup, casual clothes, warm expression, exploratory vibe. Natural sweat, eyeliner slightly smudged.

Setting: Summer nightless night in Oulu. Pale blue sky, soft horizon sun, birch trees, red-brick factory. Cigarette smoke, laughter, distant bass.

Atmosphere: Realistic, warm, slightly gritty. Warehouse interior with halogen lamps, red/orange tones, minimal strobe, light smoke. Outside friendly circles, grass, laughter.

Movement: Camera stays locked on her face as she walks, enters, sits, laughs, dances lightly. Background dynamic, kinetic, chaotic during rave peaks.

Color: Exterior pale blue and white tones; interior warm red/yellow halogen. Low contrast, soft film-like texture. Minimal artificial glow.

Energy Curve: Verses = exploration and authenticity. Chorus = swirling crowd motion. Bridge = introspective trance moment. Final = joyful release.

Overall: Intimate, naturalistic portrayal of 2006 Oulu underground rave culture. Secretive but communal. Warm, human, honest.
