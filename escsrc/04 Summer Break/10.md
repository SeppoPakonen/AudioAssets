Tässä tulee koko **30 klipin päivitys**, jossa kaikissa savuefekteissä käytetään **erillistä savukonetta / savukranaattia / ground-level smoke source** auton takana — aina erillään itse autosta tai pyörästä.
Sora ei mene näistä sekaisin, ja savusta tulee kaunista, ilmavaa ja hyvälaatuista.

# 🌴 **30 KORJATTUA KLIPPIÄ (AUTO + ERILLINEN SAVUKONE)**

### 1

A hyperrealistic still-camera shot of a bright tropical beach walkway, tourists in swimsuits passing slowly. A vintage convertible drives left to right with no smoke. A small ground-level smoke machine placed on the road directly behind the car releases thick swirling white smoke drifting low across the asphalt in the heat.

### 2

A sun-bleached wooden pier at noon, shimmering heat haze on the water, a couple dangling their legs over the edge while a plastic bottle floats lazily past.

### 3

A calm resort pool, nearly motionless water reflecting blinding sunlight, a single inflatable flamingo partially deflated at the edge, children’s shadows moving through the frame.

### 4

A roadside fruit stand under scorching light, the melons appearing slightly melted. A cyclist in beachwear passes by, heat ripples distorting the asphalt.

### 5

A tropical bus stop with thick vegetation. A bus pulls in, releasing no exhaust. A small ground smoke machine behind the bus produces soft rolling white smoke drifting under the vehicle.

### 6

A wide shot of a beach parking lot. An old luxury car idles in the sun without emitting smoke. A ground-level smoke emitter placed a few meters behind the car sends out elegant swirling white smoke spreading along the warm sand.

### 7

A quiet nature trail with orange sunlight filtering through palm leaves. Hikers walk by a small warped sign reading “Hotter than yesterday”.

### 8

A calm shoreline scene, waves lapping slowly, a pile of colorful beach trash arranged almost artistically, joggers passing in the background.

### 9

A rocky viewpoint over turquoise sea, camera static, tourists taking selfies. A distant industrial haze on the horizon.

### 10

A café terrace glowing in warm sun, iced drinks melting unnaturally fast as a sudden gust scatters napkins like butterflies.

### 11

A zen-like shot of a hammock between palm trees, a man napping, sunscreen dripping from the bottle like honey in the heat.

### 12

An idyllic waterfall pool, swimmers laughing, a floating plastic toy spinning slowly in a swirling eddy.

### 13

A hot coastal road. A vintage motorbike rides past with clean emissions. A small smoke canister lies on the pavement behind it, releasing drifting white smoke that spreads low like mist.

### 14

A resort garden at sunset, sprinklers running, children running through them, steam rising from overheated stones.

### 15

A cliffside viewpoint, tourists enjoying the scenery, binocular stand covered in tiny rust spots from salty heat.

### 16

A boardwalk ice cream vendor, cones melting instantly, customers laughing as drops fall like wax.

### 17

A peaceful harbor with boats bobbing. A small portable smoke machine on the dock releases gentle white puffs drifting over the water, independent of any boat.

### 18

A tropical forest riverbank, monkeys lurking, a tourist kayak drifting by, plastic wrappers caught in tree roots.

### 19

A highway overlook, palm trees bending in the wind. A classic car zooms past with no exhaust. A ground-level festival smoke emitter behind it bursts out a trail of drifting white smoke that rolls along the road.

### 20

A silent morning beach, lone jogger passing, washed-up seaweed tangled with a torn shopping bag.

### 21

A stylish outdoor bar at golden hour, frozen cocktails sweating profusely, neon signs flickering from heat.

### 22

A beach volleyball court, players moving in slow motion, thick sunlight making everything glow unnaturally warm.

### 23

A serene mountaintop viewpoint, hikers resting, distant haze turning the horizon orange-pink.

### 24

A shady town square with fountains, water evaporating visibly, pigeons hopping through heat shimmer.

### 25

A resort balcony overlooking the sea, towels drying, decorative fire pits glowing faintly.

### 26

A calm bus ride through a tropical town, camera looking outward, palm trees passing slowly, smog hanging low.

### 27

A river delta with fishing boats, nets drying, microplastics sparkling in the sun like confetti.

### 28

A beach market, colorful textiles waving, a crate of fish smoking slightly as if too warm, shoppers milling around.

### 29

A sunset beach party, torches lit. Behind a parked scooter sits a smoke canister on the sand, releasing soft drifting smoke illuminated by orange torchlight.

### 30

A long contemplative shot of an empty beach road at dusk. A lone vintage car rolls slowly past with clean air behind it. A ground-level smoke machine positioned a few meters back on the road produces wide, rolling white smoke drifting toward the camera in the warm evening glow.

# 🚤 **10 moottorivene + savukone -klippiä**

*(jokainen itsenäinen, valmis Soraan)*

### 1

A hyperrealistic still shot of a sunny marina. A small motorboat moves slowly past the camera with no emissions. A ground-level smoke machine hidden on the dock directly behind its path releases thick swirling white smoke drifting low over the water, while clean white sailboats remain motionless nearby.

### 2

A tropical harbor at noon, static camera. A motorboat glides from left to right. A floating smoke canister positioned a few meters behind it on the water surface releases soft rolling white smoke that spreads like mist. Several sailboats beside it remain perfectly clean and serene.

### 3

A calm turquoise bay. A speeding motorboat cuts through the water leaving a trail of choppy waves. A buoy-mounted smoke emitter behind its route produces swirling white smoke drifting close to the surface. A large sailboat to the left remains crystal clean.

### 4

A picturesque dock with warm golden sunlight. A family boards a motorboat. A small portable smoke machine placed on the dock edge behind the boat produces soft billowing smoke drifting across the wood planks, while a sailboat tied next to it looks untouched by any haze.

### 5

A wide sunset shot over calm water. A motorboat idles in the foreground. A smoke canister set on a floating platform directly behind it emits slow rolling white smoke across the water. A tall sailboat behind it remains visually pristine in the orange light.

### 6

A still-camera view of a busy beach harbor. A motorboat pulls away from the pier without emitting anything. Behind its wake, a submerged smoke emitter tied to a buoy releases drifting pale smoke across the water. Next to it, several sailboats sit perfectly untouched.

### 7

A hot midday lagoon. A motorboat cruises gently toward the right. A smoke machine fixed to a small dock ladder behind the vessel produces swirling white smoke sliding across the waterline. A clean white sailboat anchored nearby reflects the bright sun.

### 8

A serene coastal viewpoint looking down at a harbor. A motorboat leaves the dock. A small smoke device attached to a floating fishing crate behind it releases slow expanding smoke that spreads across the surface. A row of sailboats nearby remains clear and elegant.

### 9

A quiet marina walkway. A motorboat passes close to shore. A ground smoke machine tucked behind a piling emits thick white smoke that drifts outward as if trailing the boat. A moored sailboat beside it shows no haze.

### 10

A still evening scene on glassy water. A motorboat glides past with clean lines. A floating smoke bomb behind it emits soft rolling smoke that spreads low and wide. A beautiful sailboat drifting just meters away gleams untouched in the fading light.

Biisi 42 ️▶️Ilmastonmuutos-biisi 🎤
Tämä on "Kesä 2006 (Liian kuuma)" ikuisuusprojekti, jonka sanoitin loppuun viime päivinä ✨
Ei mitään muistikuvia synnystä. Tais kertoa vain kuumuudesta alunperin, mutta lukion biologiaa lukemalla tämä muuttui nopeaa ilmastonmuutos-biisksi. 🖋 Kappaleet ovat täysin 100% käsin itse sävellettyjä, sanoitettuja ja sovitettuja, mutta ne on tuotettu Suno musiikki-tekoälyllä. 🎛 Video on generoitu Sora AI:lla.
