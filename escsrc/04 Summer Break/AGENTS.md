# Summer Break
Album number 4. The material of summer of 2006, when I killed the band called The Vice and just wrote songs. Dates are rough estimates.

Scope
- The summer of 2006 compositions and 2020-2025 packaging. Many lyric `.txt` files are early EN drafts; several include detailed “Inspiraatioteksti” and structure/syllable breakdowns.

Content Notes (from .txt)
- Themes: cultural/media critique (algorithmic control, exhibitionism, time theft), summer freedom vs social pressures, playful experiments (Dancing Song, Pirate Song) alongside darker commentary (Warm Face, Dark Throne).
- Craft: frequent inclusion of “Style” blocks and formal structure specs; strong attention to syllable counts and end-rhyme schemes.

Psychological Notes (light)
- Locus of control conflict: algorithmic coercion vs human autonomy; shame vs exhibitionism.
- Systems thinking: anger toward monopolies, “soft law” control, and moral outsourcing.
- Coping and parody: high-energy forms channel critique into danceable/chantable frames.

Conventions
- Convert `.txt` → `.md` using Prom-era template (Inspiration, Structure with counts, Lyrics FI/EN where applicable, Notes). Preserve original structure math.
- Rename `.tg` files to official English song titles; keep the `2006 readonly separator` intact in `.upp` and reflect renames there.
- List `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first in the `.upp` file list.

Next Actions
- Prioritize `.md` conversion for files already carrying “Structure/Style” sections.
- Keep FI/EN parity in any album/Archive texts; label EN assistance clearly.
- Add stable cover image asset; avoid committing large binaries unless essential.
