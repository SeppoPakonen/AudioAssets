Package: 04 Summer Break

Scope
- 2006 compositions and 2025 packaging. Many lyric `.txt` files are rough English demos.

Conventions
- Convert legacy lyric `.txt` to structured `.md` (see Prom package markdown structure as reference).
- Rename `.tg` files to official English song titles; keep the `2006 readonly separator` as-is in `.upp`.
- List `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first in the `.upp` file list.

Tasks
- See `CURRENT_TASK.md` here and `/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
