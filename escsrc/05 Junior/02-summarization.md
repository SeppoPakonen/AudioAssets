# The Battle for Disclosure: Dr. Steven Greer on the Looming False Flag and the Secret UFO Economy

In a recent and wide-ranging interview, Dr. Steven Greer provides a stark update on the state of the UFO disclosure movement, the existence of a "transnational criminal organization" managing legacy programs, and what he describes as a sophisticated psychological operation designed to "gaslight" the public into fearing an extraterrestrial threat.

## The Criminality of the Legacy Programs
Dr. Greer begins by highlighting his work over the past two to three years with a dedicated law enforcement task force. This group is specifically researching the criminal aspects of what he calls a "transnational criminal organization" (or "Tinko") that operates the legacy UFO programs. According to Greer, senior officials in the intelligence community now acknowledge that his 30 years of research are "100% accurate."

The core of the issue, Greer argues, is not just the secrecy itself but the corruption that facilitates it. He claims that operatives within the media and the internet world are actively suppressing information and "altering the truth." Specifically, he asserts that technologies derived from extraterrestrial systems—what he calls "human tech"—have been built with unapproved, off-budget, and illegal funds. These technologies are allegedly being used by aerospace contractors for criminal enterprises ranging from kidnapping and "wet work" (assassinations) to drug and arms running. This, Greer states, is the heart of a "RICO racketeering" conspiracy.

## The Manufactured "Threat Narrative"
A significant portion of the interview focuses on the "false flag" narrative. Greer warns that the public is being prepared for a dystopian future where the world is "united" not by peace, but by a shared fear of an alien invasion. He points to several key figures and media projects as part of this deception:

*   **Steven Spielberg and "Age of Disclosure":** Greer recounts a dinner with Max Spielberg (Steven’s son), where they discussed how the director’s perspective shifted from the positive portrayals in *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* and *E.T.* to more fearful themes. Greer claims Spielberg was targeted by an "electronic warfare system" involving a fake, negative "alien home invasion" to brainwash him into supporting the threat narrative.
*   **Lue Elizondo and Others:** Greer labels certain prominent figures in the "UFO community" as operatives who have been "warning people away" from investigating human-made technologies by presenting them as extraterrestrial or foreign threats (like the "Tic Tac" craft).
*   **Hollywood’s Role:** He describes the upcoming big-budget films and documentaries as "horror flicks" designed to hit "fear buttons" and "stampede the world into panic."

## The Subversion of Political Power
Greer asserts that even the highest levels of government have been neutralized. He claims to have personally warned presidents and members of oversight committees about these programs. He notes that Bill Clinton’s administration was "threatened and then induced" into silence, and that the last president to "aggressively resolve" the issue was John F. Kennedy.

The technology at the center of this—"zero-point energy"—is being withheld because its release would collapse the current global financial system. Greer references a statement from a UK banker (published in *The Guardian*) suggesting that the banking system would collapse if the U.S. released this information. Greer argues that while a transition to free energy is necessary, the "big money people" are using the threat of financial collapse as a "scare tactic" to maintain control.

## The "Electronic Black Magic" and the Future
Describing the technology as "electronic black magic," Greer explains that it is possible to "pop things in from another dimension" using advanced electronics reverse-engineered from ET systems. He cites the case of Prince Albert of Liechtenstein, who was allegedly abducted from his castle in a "classic CIA psy-op" designed to make him hate extraterrestrials and fund "abduction cults" to push the evil-alien narrative.

Greer warns that if disclosure happens under the current "threat" framework, it will lead to a "civilizational ending" or "Armageddon." He calls for a massive public education and PR push to counter this "false narrative."

## A Spiritual Warrior Approach
Finally, Greer discusses the societal impact of the internet and social media, which he describes as "mind-numbing" tools that make people passive and depressed. He advocates for a "spirit warrior" or "Shambala warrior" mindset—achieving a state of higher consciousness where one is informed but not afraid.

The extraterrestrials, Greer claims, are waiting for humanity to reach a level of "coherent evolution" and "higher consciousness" before making peaceful contact. He concludes by emphasizing that his mission is to "protect the human future" and ensure that disclosure leads to a "new and wonderful world" rather than a global catastrophe.
