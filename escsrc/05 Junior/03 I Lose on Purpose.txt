Style:
A dark, atmospheric electronic track with a driving beat and a rapper and a vocalist.
The tempo is moderate, around 120 BPM.
The key is minor, creating a melancholic mood.
The instrumentation primarily features synthesized drums, a prominent bassline, and atmospheric synth pads.
The drums consist of a kick, snare, and hi-hat, with occasional cymbal crashes.
The bassline is deep and resonant, providing a strong rhythmic foundation.
The synth pads create a sustained, ethereal backdrop.
The male vocalist delivers the lyrics in a spoken-word style, with a deep, resonant voice.
The vocal delivery is rhythmic and almost rap-like, but without melodic singing.
There are occasional vocal ad-libs and spoken phrases that add to the atmospheric quality.
The production is clean and spacious, with a focus on the interplay between the rhythmic elements and the atmospheric synths.
The track has a consistent energy level throughout, building subtly with the addition of vocal layers and slight variations in the synth textures.
The song structure is verse-chorus based, with a clear distinction between the more narrative verses and the repeated, impactful chorus.

Title: Feng Shui On Point

[Chorus: female singing]
Your feng shui is on point
Your feng shui is on point

[Verse 1: male rapping]
See, sweetness—see the sleekness speeding past your lane?
See what I see, scenery painted clean to calm the brain,
You rock a cherry red—yeah, clear as traffic light,
But no near shades to blend, no tones to make it right,
You style then snarl—share scarce, spit sparks in spite,
I’m thinking, “Paranoid, baby—you bar the sight,”
I coax, I coach—no go, won’t coat them walls,
Our corners call for color, but you stall them all,
I can’t, I can’t—can’t get your hand to paint,
You rant, you rant—like art’s a sin for saints,
You won’t—nah, don’t—won’t frame the room I’m in,
So I rhyme and prime the vibe you’re dimming thin,
Palette, balance—gallons ready, rollers primed,
But you panic at the canvas when it’s showtime,
Let the line find shine—let the grain gain grace,
’Cause a blank stays cold when it should hold space.

[Chorus: female singing]
Your feng shui is on point but shut tight
Not like my style guide, spread it wide
Don’t hoard, keep it breathing

[Verse 2: male rapping]
With you, the mood is smooth—harmonics hum and flow,
But peace so bleached, so blank, no hue, no afterglow,
You grin and claim it’s yours—“got everything I need,”
But no one buys that calm, your mind won’t match the deed,
You praise the pretty still—yeah, props to charm,
But you admit you can’t craft it—no stroke, no arm,
A snow-white room we’ve seen—too clean, too cold,
My qi leaks out the seams, your taste feels old,
I crave a richer mix—some soul, some grain,
Some wood, some wool, some gold to hold the rain,
You freeze the breeze—please, let color cut through gloom,
Let rhythm live, forgive the rigid in the room,
Layer texture—measure pressure, let the forms align,
Tie a stripe with light—pull the thread through time,
We can blend, my friend—warm the edges, bend the rules,
 Turn the hush to lush—let the hush hold jewels.

[Chorus: female singing]
Your feng shui is on point but shut tight
Not like my style guide, spread it wide
Don’t hoard, keep it breathing

[Bridge: female singing]
You gray my heart away when your colors fade,
My pulse turns dusk when light won’t cross the shade,
I reach in brushstrokes, hush the hush you grew,
But your palette’s missing—still, I’m painting you.
Your feng shui is on point but shut tight
Your feng shui is on point but shut tight
 
[Chorus: female singing]
Your feng shui is on point but shut tight
Not like my style guide, spread it wide
Don’t hoard, keep it breathing

[Chorus: female singing]
Feng shui is on point but shut tight
Not like my style guide, spread it wide
Don’t hoard, keep it breathing

[Outro]
It aches—uh, uh, uh.
Till we share the beauty, it’ll ache again.
