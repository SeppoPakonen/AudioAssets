Album number 5. The material of lateof 2006, when I formed the hiphop band called PMS (= Prio, Milja, Seppo) with my classmates. I changed the genre from Rock to Rap/Hiphop.

Scope
- Late 2006 compositions with 2025 packaging. Several lyric `.txt` files are early EN demos; FI often present as canonical.

Content Notes (from .txt)
- Themes: heartbreak and ambivalence (Heartbeat), temptation and self-restraint (It Could Be So), self-sabotage and regret (I Lose on Purpose), style/culture snapshots (Timberland).
- Form: FI leads with EN translations/drafts; duet/rap-sung hybrids; strong refrains.

Psychological Notes (light)
- Attachment insecurity: anxious–avoidant swings, fear of abandonment, fear of engulfment.
- Cognitive dissonance: acknowledging harm while seeking repair; tension between desire and values.
- Growth edges: explicit reflection and accountability begin to appear in bridges/outros.

Conventions
- Convert lyric `.txt` → `.md` using Prom-era sections; mark speaker roles where applicable (e.g., female chorus / male rap).
- Keep the `2006 readonly separator` and any other separators intact in `.upp`.
- Rename `.tg` files to official English titles; mirror changes in `.upp`.
- List `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first in the `.upp` file list.

Tasks
- See `CURRENT_TASK.md` here and `/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
