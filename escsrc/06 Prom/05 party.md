## Style


### 2025
Sunny club-pop at 100–104 BPM in C major (Ionian with a Mixolydian grin).
Harmony: loop I–V–vi–IV. Hooks ride root/3rd/5th; bass walks with soft sidechain.
Engine: round plucky bass (sub + gentle harmonics), light sat; bright piano stabs, muted funk guitar; one cheerful foley logo (camera click/ice clink).
Drums: tight kick, clap/snare stack, crisp hats with 1/16 sprinkles, shaker/tambo lifts; sprinkle conga taps.
Synths: warm Juno pads, airy bells, polite supersaw for chorus bloom; playful reverse swells, micro wow/flutter for charm.
Vocal: upbeat talk-sing male in verses; melodic hooks with octave nudges + “oh-oh/hey-yeah” micro-hooks; thirds/fifths stacks, light vocoder gloss, higher-formant ad-libs.
Form: Verse → 8-bar pre (rising toms + HPF) → call/response chorus → 2-bar post-chorus motif; one drumless pad+breaths+crowd whoop, then full return; final chorus adds harmonies + counter-synth.
Mix: clean/wide, short plate on lead, spring on guitar, slap on ad-libs; target -9 to -8 LUFS, no brick.
Rooftop-happy, P&L of joy.


## Lyrics (EN, draft)
Title: Continental Commute (Coach & Carriage Confessional)
```
[Chorus]
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.

[Verse 1]
A drip won’t drown you, no one sinks in a train;
conductors don’t clock out, and grinders don’t complain.
If you hush and can’t hack it—can’t handle the strain,
you’re kind to a fault or your liver runs plain.
’Cause tonight we ride the rail, inhale the ale as we go,
no straw in the bottle—from the neck with a flow.
Eyes glaze in the aisle when the night lights flash,
hey miss—park your man, grab a bunk, stash your cash.

[Chorus]
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, you’re my platform one, my run;
tiny request—ditch weekday dread, hit sun.
Let go, let rails hum—music in the bus;
I banked my whiskey—the coach holds us.
Drop your worries on the parquet floor,
best angle—tango—your carry-on core.
No sleep tonight; the sleeper’s a rave,
hands high—stamp time—let the minutes misbehave.

[Chorus]
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.

[Bridge]
Can’t find a punchline premium enough;
maybe you’d rather comp two drinks and bluff.
Host—double-doubles, neat—no ice;
come morning you won’t text “wanker,” or “dick”—be nice.
Call me day-to-day hero of coach and clutch;
I help the girls—when consent says “such.”
Yep, yep—label me principal seat;
no regrets at dawn for the words on repeat. 

[Chorus]
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
We're rolling—say it straight if you’re boarding.
```
