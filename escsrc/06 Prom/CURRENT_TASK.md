Current Task — 06 Prom

- Active draft: maintain and refine `Love is my song.md`.
- Verify syllable counts and structure against composition `01 cheap spirit.tg` (2007).
- Clean/convert any `.txt` drafts to `.md` structure consistent across albums 01–06.
- Rename `.tg` files that carry old project names to the official English song titles; update `.upp` list accordingly.
- Keep `2007` and `2025` separators intact in `.upp`; do not alter year groupings.
- Plan and create the album cover image for this album.
- Keep `06 Prom.upp` file list in sync and retain ordering.
- Coordinate with root `/CURRENT_TASK.md` for overall priorities.
