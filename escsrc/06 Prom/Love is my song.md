# Love Is My Song

## Inspiration text
```
Rakkaus on minun tekstini.
Haluat omia sen itsellesi.
Kuinka sinun hellimisesi voisi olla sinun omaisuutta?
Olet asiakas, et muuta.
Möin tuotettani liian halvalla.
Annoin jopa sinun varastaa sen.
En enää.
Ympärilläni on enää kylmää kyynisyyttä, kun vääristit kauneuden rumuudeksi.
Minun rakkauden tunteeni liikkuvat hyvän elämän henkimaailmassa.
Eli jossain määrin rakkaus ei tunne rajoja... mutta sinä ansaitset saada isän kädestä oppiaksesi... enkä ole opettaja.
Minua kutsuu lämpimämmät ajatukset, mikä tällä hetkellä tuo onnen sävelet.
Rakkaudessa on myös aina viesti isommista asioista, se ei ole vain minun tuulella ajelehtimista.
Elämän luominen on rakkautta, mutta niin myös sen ylläpitäminen.
Et voi luoda vain, jotta se tuhoutuu heti kun hylkäät sen.
Et voi laittaa törkeän ylikallista hintalappua, jotta se kuuluisi harvoille ja valituille.
Rakkaus on myös tilastollista, eikä vain yhden yksilön onni.
Ja tilastollista rakastajaa kukaan ei tunne.
En halunnut olla sellainenkaan.
Tekstini ovat tosia: niillä on lähettäjä ja vastaanottaja.
Sinä et ollut oikea vastaanottaja.
Rakkauteni meni liian usein väärään osoitteeseen, eikä kukaan välittänyt.
Keräsin paketteja itselleni.
Lopulta löysin ostajan.
Sellaisen, joka ei vain varastoi niitä piiloon.
Sellaisen, joka tietää, että näkyvillä ollessaankin niiden on hankala saada vastaanottajia.
Sellaisen, joka vaalii niitä vaikean maailman keskellä.

## Suno style 1
- This track is a hip-hop piece with a strong reggae influence, featuring a vocalist rapping and a vocalist singing over a sparse, rhythmic instrumental
- The tempo is moderate, and the key is minor, contributing to a somewhat melancholic or reflective mood
- The instrumentation primarily consists of a prominent, deep bassline that drives the rhythm, a simple drum beat with a clear kick and snare, and a high-pitched, almost synth-like melody that plays intermittently
- There are also subtle, atmospheric synth pads in the background
- The vocal delivery in verses is a spoken-word rap style, with a clear, somewhat monotone delivery that occasionally incorporates melodic inflections
- The vocal delivery in verses is a R&B singing style
- Production elements include a clean mix with the vocals prominent, and a slight reverb on the vocals and some instrumental elements, giving a sense of space
- The song structure is verse-chorus based, with instrumental breaks
- The melody is simple and repetitive, acting more as a rhythmic counterpoint than a lead melodic line
- The overall feel is laid-back but with an underlying intensity

## Suno style (improved 2025)
* This track is a pop-rap / alt-R\&B hybrid with light Afrobeats seasoning and a faint reggae shadow, featuring one rapper and one singer over a sparse, rhythmic bed built for 2025 playlists.
* The tempo is moderate (\~99 BPM) and the key stays minor (F♯m/A minor), sustaining a reflective mood while the chorus lifts the emotional P\&L into the black.
* The instrumentation primarily consists of a tight, deep 808-driven bassline, a simple kick–snare grid with occasional Jersey-club fills, and a bright FM-pluck lead that drops in as an intermittent hook.
* There are also subtle, low-passed atmospheric pads that swell in pre-chorus and bridge for air and headroom.
* The vocal delivery in verses is a clear, spoken-word rap with tasteful melodic tails and internal rhyme—measured swagger, ROI on every syllable.
* The vocal delivery in verses is a contrasting alt-R\&B stack: lead + doubles + airy octave harmonies that answer the rap lines.
* Production elements include a vocal-forward, clean mix; short plate on leads, longer hall in choruses; modern ear-candy (reverse swipes, micro tape-stops, tiny vocal chops) for scroll-stopping sheen.
* The song structure is verse–pre–chorus–chorus with intentional instrumental breaks, a half-time bridge, and a tight 2:30–2:40 runtime engineered for clips and repeat plays.

**Intro (female rapping)**
Love is my message, kiddo. (7)
You try to own it, homie, now. (8)
How can your spoiling be yours? (7)
Customer—not lover—sign and buy-in. (10)

**Instrumental — short spoken (non-rhyming):**
“Scope the contract: romance is billable, but my spirit stays non-transferable.”

**Verse 1 (female rapping)**
Sold it cheap, for pennies, on purpose, man. (9)
Let you jack it freely, really, greedy kid. (11)
Not anymore—door closed, code changed, no returns. (11)
Cold cynics circling—you flipped fine to foul, for show, bro. (13)
My love moves in better ether now. (9)
Borderless, sorta, in spirit—that’s real, kid. (11)
You deserve ... to learn, but I ain’t teacher here. (11)
Warm thoughts call me; melodies manage my wins, right now. (13)
Love speaks on bigger business. (7)
Not just my moods afloat now, kid. (8)
Making life is love, yes, fact. (7)
But maintenance counts too, for you. (8)
Can’t build to bail instantly. (7)
Can’t price it absurd-exclusive. (8)
For chosen few with gatekeys. (7)
Love also runs numbers, not one dude’s joy, on charts, for all. (14)

**Chorus (male singing)**
Know the sender. (4)
Find receiver. (4)
Wrong address—ice. (4)
Deliver. (3)

**Verse 2 (male rapping)**
No one knows the stat lover, either. (9)
I refused that role, soul, whole—alone, bro. (11)
My texts are true, with routing and stamps on them. (11)
Sender, receiver—your name ain’t it; face fake labels. (13)
Mail kept missing houses for years, straight. (9)
Nobody cared—cold storage like morgue back then. (11)
So I stacked my packages—backlogged, heavy. (11)
Finally found a buyer, not a hoarder, ever. (13)
Keeps them seen, still scarce out there. (7)
Knows the open ain’t easy, roads. (8)
Audience slow to answer. (7)
Still he shields and stewards these words. (8)
Mid chaos, care continues—true. (7)
Value in view, not vaults—no moths. (8)
Beauty unbent from ugly. (7)
Guarded like glass, yet passed hand to hand, in storms and markets. (14)

**Chorus (male singing)**
Know the sender. (4)
Find receiver. (4)
Wrong address—ice. (4)
Deliver. (3)

**Bridge (Chant — Chorus-form)**
Brand the sender, bender, now. (7)
Mark receiver, believer, now. (8)
Fix the address—less stress, please. (7)
Sign it, send it, end it, friend, now. (8)
Price the love right, sunlight, bright. (7)
Drop the gate rates, spread it wide now. (8)
Stats in the heart, charted, hard. (7)
Scale that care, share fair, repair what despair tried to tear down. (14)

**Chorus (male singing)**
Know the sender. (4)
Find receiver. (4)
Wrong address—ice. (4)
Deliver. (3)

**Outro — short spoken (non-rhyming):**
“From mispriced love to enterprise love—KPIs met: kindness per incident.”

**Outro — manly noises:**
“Mmm.” “Uh-huh.” Slow exhale, chest tap, low hum.
