Title: Girlfriend from Canada
Style:
A high-energy punk rock song in a major key,
featuring a driving rhythm section of drums and bass guitar,
The electric guitar plays distorted power chords and melodic riffs,
The male lead vocalist delivers a raw, slightly strained performance, often shouting,
The song structure is verse-chorus with instrumental breaks,
The tempo is fast and consistent,
Production is high quality with a prominent drum sound and a slightly muddy guitar tone,
The bass provides a solid, driving low end


[Verse 1]
After summer, we saw him first time
He looked like making suicide
He told how everyone will hate him
He told how how he's pet rat died
He felt to ground and pretended crying
Asked God why he's girlfriend died
We heard that the girl was from Canada
They met in chat but she blocked him there
Hey, we know you act, we know you lie
We know that your girlfriend hasn't ever died
Somewhere in the North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
After a year what he said was so true
All hated him but for reason
He always whined but never listened
He was violent and played a ninja but
Came a day when he wanted to change
Wanna have friends and be happy
One of the girls who was there at the first day
Shook her head and made clear to him that

[Chorus]
We know you act and we know you lie
We know that your girlfriend hasn't ever died
Somewhere in the North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
After few year he really felt it
When taking risks wasn't anymore fun
It's so hard to be a boy friendly
When no one ever ever speak to him
He came to school and pulled out his gun
Killed himself in front of everyone
Now, the girl is on his fresh grave and her
Words can be heard in the air that

[Chorus]
We knew you act, And we knew you lie,
we know that your girlfriend hadn't ever died
Somewhere in the fucking Canada
