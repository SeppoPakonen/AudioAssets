Chorus
We are talking to express our emotions 
Me requesting you to tell me directly if you're feeling overwhelmed 

Verse 1
Me saying a hug of comfort won't destroy you, nobody will be swallowed by their troubles, women won't judge you, and rappers won't sleep on your issues 
Me saying that being silent can't ignore it, too kind or too vulnerable 
Crying to cope with our emotions, sharing our feelings with each other in contrast to venting to let out the pain 
Males leaning when faced with difficult situations 
Asking the girl for support from her boyfriend to find a way out somewhere 
Showing something that the old rubbers have to be discarded 
Asking the miss to embrace the positive thoughts, sweet dreams of a better future, and open a new one just for you 
Saying that there has been too much sadness in contrast to not enough courage, and to take it easy and not drown in sorrows, shhh let's find a way 

Chorus

Verse 2
Me, a man, saying you're my number one, requesting to forget the hard times and let go of the past 
Preparing music to calm and tears to heal 
You sharing worries on the journey of self-discovery, showing your best side and determination, not sleeping but tears to keep going, putting dancers off the hospital bed when ready to heal, not being stupid but using courage, looking beautiful on the inside, taking a hug and weeping courage, and grabbing a hand to fix this tonight 

Bridge
Me finding a punch line worthy of you, offering to pay for the cost of healing, and ordering twice double embrace 
You in contrast not to call me a wanker or useless gay in the morning, but rather call me an everyday hero 
Me being called principal and having no regret about what I said in the morning
