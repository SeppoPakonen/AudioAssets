Chorus 
You are leading by example, guiding others to a better future,
and spreading truth like an unstoppable force.
Love bonds our progress and the romance of joy is eternal.

Verse 1
We have big dreams and open minds;
time flies as we make history and create new paths.
We appreciate life illuminated by knowledge and question the gods unfurled by understanding.
Our story has new Romes blazing with battalions of support
and Yankees forging shoes to be danced in by harmony, sending love to heal.
Our artillery puts even the wisest into a state of clarity
and our politics dance from privileged to empowered.
Man celebrates in joy, toasting reality with booze
and addictions take control of the golden path.
When asked, speak up; when storming, stay brave and don't take pride.
Religions fulfill their true purpose, history repeats itself with soldiers
and partners and we create visions of future unity.

Chorus 

Verse 2
Peacekeepers are angels, but in contrast, they can be destroyers.
They question how to achieve peace with intelligence but in contrast,
use understanding and wisdom to make informed decisions.
Their power is used responsibly, but in contrast, small acts can shine.
They give charity, but in contrast, hug the outcast and spread love with verbal bullets.
They create a fire to burn outdated ideas to the end, but in contrast, it unifies diverse people.
Neither deity, but in contrast, Buddha teaches.
Will provides comfort to the weak and the flower of kindness is kept alive by love and watered.
But in contrast, sprouts of hope let many people tell the world.
