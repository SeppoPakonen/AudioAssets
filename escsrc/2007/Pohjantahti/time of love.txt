Verse 1
I'm requesting that you close your eyes and listen to my voice.
My heart is hurting because of our differences.
I ran away without a clear direction and I'm requesting understanding from you.
I'm asking for attention, yet not giving any in return.
I've lost hope with you, and the world has become foggy from our interactions.
You argue with me behind my back and to my face. You're smoking herbs and drinking tea.
I'm requesting that you close your eyes and mouth at the same time
and interrupt negative thoughts with a kiss.
I'm trying to keep my emotions in check,
but at the same time, looking back fondly with joy. 

Chorus
I'm saying "hey girl," our feelings converted and created beauty.
I'm saying "hey girl," our love lasts forever in our hearts.
I'm saying "hey girl," our relationship was a time of love.

Verse 2
I remember how our relationship was destroyed deliberately and how it ruined my life at the same time.
I don't understand why the love disappeared. You were arrogant, but also hurtful and unkind.
I apologized to you, wanting to make things right,
confessed how much I loved you, admitted I made mistakes with your friends secretly and in contrast,
hugged you. I forgave myself for taking your money.
I couldn't stand your coldness and realized it was all my fault and accepted it with you.
You loved me, which is what you wanted from me, but you had affairs all over the city.
In contrast, my heart was longing for you.

Chorus

Verse 3
I understand that argument leads nowhere.
My heart is hot, but there's no spark in my heart from you.
I'm said to be ugly and not daring to provoke or look at you like a machine that grinds away.
I exaggerate when I'm angry, my feelings come and go and you changed.
I fucked us only inside the side, but fucked us all over the place.
There was something wrong with me because I loved you, but now my heart is cold like winter.
I'm sad, maybe, seeing you as strangers with a glass of wine in my hand when the break up was inevitable.
You cried, but I'm expected to fucking from behind only in dreams
where justice is served and you get what you deserve.
The nights are cold without you and the days are boring without you,
but I manage just fine without you.
