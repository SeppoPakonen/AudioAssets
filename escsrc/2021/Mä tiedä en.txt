[Chorus]
Mä tiedä en, tiedä en, 
et missä oot nyt.
Kun viestii lähties et jättänyt et jättänyt. 
Ei susta jää, susta jäänyt johtolankaa.
Kun menit lähteen ennen aamua, aamua. 

[Verse 1]
Kuulen mä iltaa viettäessä että missä on muut
ja mitä niille siellä tapahtuu.
Kun kuului huhu, että joku suutelee esteettä.
Oli varmaan virhe kiinnostuu.

[Prechorus 1]
On vaikea
sut unohtaa
vaik tuntees on
ekstaasia
Aidolta se tuntui
vaikka kemikaali sussa vain puhui

[Chorus]
Mä tiedä en, tiedä en, 
et missä oot nyt.
Kun viestii lähties et jättänyt et jättänyt. 
Ei susta jää, susta jää nyt johtolankaa.
Kun menit lähteen ennen aamua, aamua. 

[Verse 2]
Mä toivoin kai enemmän kuin tää et jää ei mitään
ja yllättää et pian pettyy näin
Et kai tilannut mua, alkoi vain tapahtua
Sait bailattua, mut taisin rakastua

[Prechorus 2]
On vaikea
se uskoa
et parempaa
on karata
Tahtonut en pahaa
Mutta otin kaiken vastaantulevan

[Chorus]
Mä tiedä en, tiedä en, 
et missä oot nyt.
Kun viestii lähties et jättänyt et jättänyt. 
Ei susta jää, susta jää nyt johtolankaa.
Kun menit lähteen ennen aamua, aamua.

You help with the music generator to clarify genres and styles.

You want to get electronic drums and more electronic vibes for following promp. But you want to keep it classy for pop-rock listeners: "A melancholic pop-rock song in a minor key, featuring a female lead vocalist, The instrumentation includes a piano playing arpeggiated chords, a bass guitar providing a walking bass line, and a drum kit with a steady, understated beat, Synthesizer pads provide atmospheric backing, The song structure alternates between verses and choruses, with a distinct instrumental break, The tempo is moderate, The lead vocal is delivered in a clear, slightly melancholic tone, with some sustained notes, The production emphasizes clarity and separation of instruments, with a slight reverb on the vocals and piano"

Here’s a refined prompt that keeps the pop-rock structure and emotional tone intact, but nudges the arrangement toward a more electronic, classy vibe:

Refined Prompt:
A melancholic pop-rock song in a minor key, featuring a female lead vocalist. The instrumentation blends organic and electronic elements: a piano playing soft, arpeggiated chords; a warm, rounded synth bass providing a subtle walking bass line; and a hybrid drum kit that combines acoustic-style hits with electronic drum samples for a crisp, modern texture. Smooth synthesizer pads and gentle ambient textures provide atmospheric backing. The song structure alternates between verses and choruses, with a distinct instrumental break featuring airy synth leads. The tempo is moderate, the lead vocal is delivered in a clear, slightly melancholic tone with some sustained notes. The production emphasizes clarity and separation of instruments, with tasteful reverb on vocals and piano, and a polished, contemporary mix that appeals to pop-rock listeners while adding a refined electronic touch.

If you want, I can also give you two variations — one leaning more toward electro-pop and one toward indie electronic-rock — so you can feed them into the generator and see which feels best. Would you like me to do that?

I can only think 90s triphop, but that's not it. Whatever is closer.

<<<<
Got it — you’re aiming for something not as heavy and moody as 90s trip-hop, but still with that electronic sophistication, while keeping the pop-rock DNA.

The closest modern territory to what you described is probably:

    Dream pop with electronic elements — airy, melancholic, but still melodic and accessible for pop-rock listeners.

    Downtempo pop-rock — steady tempo, clean mix, with electronic drum textures and lush synth layers.

    Electro-acoustic pop — mixing organic instruments (piano, bass guitar) with soft synths and hybrid drums.

    Indietronica — indie rock sensibilities but dressed up with tasteful electronic production.

Here’s a prompt tuned to that indietronica / electro-acoustic pop sweet spot:

Prompt:
A melancholic indietronica ballad in a minor key, featuring a female lead vocalist. The arrangement blends acoustic and electronic textures: a soft piano plays arpeggiated chords, while a warm synth bass subtly mirrors a walking bass line. A hybrid drum kit uses brushed acoustic samples layered with crisp electronic snares and deep, electronic kick drums for a refined, understated groove. Smooth synthesizer pads and airy background textures create an atmospheric space, with occasional soft synth leads in the instrumental break. The tempo is moderate, and the lead vocal is clear, slightly melancholic, and emotional, with sustained notes for depth. Production emphasizes clarity, stereo separation, and a polished mix, with gentle reverb on vocals and piano to maintain intimacy while adding a modern electronic sheen.

If you want, I can also prepare a tighter, genre-tag-oriented version optimized for a music generator so it understands the style target more precisely. That will help avoid it going into full trip-hop or EDM territory.

Do you want me to make that “generator-friendly” version?

Also, I want more emphasis on piano. It should be more pronounced and clear, especially in intro.

<<<<
Alright — if you want the piano to be more forward, especially in the intro, we can frame it so the generator treats it as the emotional and tonal anchor of the track, while still giving you the classy electronic polish.

Here’s the revised indietronica / electro-acoustic pop prompt with pronounced piano:

Prompt:
A melancholic indietronica-influenced pop-rock song in a minor key, featuring a female lead vocalist. The arrangement opens with a pronounced, intimate piano playing clear, arpeggiated chords — warm, resonant, and full in the mix. This piano remains a central element throughout the song, guiding the harmonic progression. A smooth synth bass subtly follows a walking bass pattern. Hybrid drums combine soft acoustic hits with crisp electronic layers, keeping a steady, understated beat. Lush synthesizer pads and airy textures provide an atmospheric backdrop, while the instrumental break features a delicate, melodic synth line woven around the piano. The tempo is moderate, the lead vocal is clear, slightly melancholic, with sustained notes for emotional depth. Production emphasizes piano clarity and stereo width, with a polished mix that keeps every instrument distinct, gentle reverb on the piano and vocals, and a refined modern electronic sheen that still appeals to pop-rock listeners.

If you like, I can now give you a short, generator-friendly “tag + style” version alongside this descriptive one so the AI music generator really understands you mean:
indietronica, electro-acoustic pop, pronounced piano intro, female vocal, melancholic minor key, moderate tempo, hybrid acoustic/electronic drums.

Do you want me to prepare that compressed generator version next?
