Verse 1:
Left behind the small town grind, chasing my heart's true calling,
I'll take the risks regardless of the falling.
I used to chase shiny things,
but now I'm chasing my own wings.

Pre-Chorus 1:
As the city lights spark and spin,
I realize there's no going back again.

Chorus 1:
But I'll keep chasing, don't you see,
it's the journey that sets me free
I'll keep chasing, don't you see
defying expectations and living for me

Verse 2:
As I walk these city streets,
where every dreamer comes to compete,
the bright lights blind, but I'll never retreat

now I see it's more than just a dream,
it's a fire burning deep within me.
chasing my destiny and the beat

Pre-Chorus 2:
And I may stumble and fall,
but I'll rise again and conquer all.

Chorus 1:
I'll keep chasing, don't you see,
it's the journey that sets me free
I'll keep chasing, don't you see
defying expectations and living for me
Bridge:
With every move, I feel the weight of my choice,
but I won't let anyone drown out my inner voice.
I'll flip the script, take control of my fate,
proving to all that it's never too late.

Chorus 1:
I'll keep chasing, don't you see,
it's the journey that sets me free
I'll keep chasing, don't you see
defying expectations and living for me

Outro:
I'll keep chasing, don't you see,
