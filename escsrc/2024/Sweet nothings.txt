Title: Sweet Nothings



[Intro]
Uh, Uh, Yeah, Uh
Ow, ow, ow, Uh
can't stop us
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

[Verse 1]
she's all dolled up, it's quite peculiar,
but she's strange, just like a mirror.
if we unite, we'll achieve success,
victorious, no stress.
burying the past, cheers to champagne.
breaking free from chains.
but i can't stay, gotta be gone

[Pre-Chorus]
left out, can't match up
if you want to win, you better patch up
go wild, no stop
i'll keep going until i'm on top.
never leave your side
Gotta talk, don't hide.

[Chorus]
Ooh, uh,
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés, uh
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés
fiery touch, passion revived
The love you denied, now endless night
you tellin' me to trust flow
as you pick your stuff and go
you make me miss you so
 
[Verse 2]
can't break free from this hold, it's like a vow,
together we'll succeed, without doubt.
drowning in lust, can't escape
I won't spend time with those who only hate
your charm wins, a sure tell,
nothing wrong, all's well
wet body, won't stop, can't turn 'round
I won't join those who drag me down.

[Pre-Chorus]
left out, can't match up
if you want to win, you better patch up
go wild, no stop
i'll keep going until i'm on top.
never leave your side
Gotta talk, don't hide.

[Chorus]
Ooh, uh,
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés, uh
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés
fiery touch, passion revived
The love you denied, now endless night
you tellin' me to trust flow
as you pick your stuff and go
you make me miss you so
 
[Bridge]
not in our league, can't handle the test
if you need love, take a breath.
I'm keeping my emotions in check at all times
pretty face, perfect waist, a dime
you ain't rich, just average
In bed, I'm anything but average, sis.
If you walk away now
dress up and strut, show them how
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: rapping]
y'all feel me, can't resist it,
You always leave me feeling inadequate.
in the night, see it glowing, can't break its spell.
i can't compromise my worth for a cheap tell.
did it all for squad, true,
haters always jealous, stayin' so blue.
she got those curves, they're so wild and bold
but she's so empty, like a room with no décor.
searching for partner, no reflection,
ain't givin' in, no trust in interrogation.
bitches hear my truth, can't deny,
at the event, they're hypnotized.
gotta be rich for a taste of the good life,
perfect body, the standard for a wife
i know my worth, doubt has no hold
she say she's queen, but she can't keep the throne
blinded by desire, couldn't turn it down,
but i can't fit in with their entitled crown
i walked down the hall, eyes locked on her ass,
feeling weak as I pass.

[Chorus]
Ooh, uh,
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés, uh
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés
fiery touch, passion revived
The love you denied, now endless night
you tellin' me to trust flow
as you pick your stuff and go
you make me miss you so
















[Chorus]
Ooh, uh,
sweet nothings that you'd say, now they're just clichés, uh

your wealth and power, but what about your heart?
stars, once our destiny, now worlds apart, uh

fiery touch, passion revived
The love you denied, now endless night
you tellin' me to trust flow
as you pick your stuff and go
you make me miss you so

[Pre-Chorus]
left out, can't match up
if you want to win, you better patch up
go wild, no stop
keep going until your on top.

[Chorus]
