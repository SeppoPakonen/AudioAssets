[Verse 1]
Skateboards, torn-up jeans, and cheap guitars
We were kings of broken boulevards
No rules, no fear, just a wild excuse
Every night we had nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Summer 2006, we were loud, we were free
Middle fingers up to authority
With our hearts on fire, nothing to prove
Summer 2006, we had the attitude

[Verse 2]
Sneaking beer cans by the riverside
Shouting songs to the glowing night
We were reckless, stupid, young and fast
But we thought the feeling would always last

[Chorus]
Summer 2006, we were loud, we were free
Middle fingers up to authority
With our hearts on fire, nothing to prove
Summer 2006, we had the attitude

[Bridge]
Now the years roll on, but the fire’s not gone
Every time I hear that song, I’m back where I belong
