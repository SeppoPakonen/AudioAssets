Title: Girl I never had
Style: A male vocalist sings a melancholic pop rock song with a driving rhythm section, The song is in the key of E major and has a tempo of 90 beats per minute, The instrumentation includes a clean electric guitar playing arpeggiated chords, a bass guitar providing a walking bass line, and a drum kit with a prominent kick and snare, The vocals are delivered with a slightly strained, emotional quality, and feature a moderate amount of reverb, The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with a bridge and outro, The melody is memorable and features a relatively narrow vocal range, The production is clean and balanced, with all instruments clearly audible

[Intro]
I pulled you to the right direction
But no-one pulled me

[Verse 1]
Girl, I am gambling with you
I should have known it too
'Cos suffering ain't defending
One could have seen through this
We were a bad investment
I wasn't getting cared
All that talking over me
Is worst red flag that I can see

[Prechorus 1]
My attention is stolen
And I can't get time returned
Fuck your whole world

[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that's good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had

[Verse 2]
what I could take on the edge
Working for both our sakes
I held on the promises
While you were with someone else
Now every midnight
Memory plays on broken frames
of your secret smile, your stolen games

[Prechorus 2]
Yeah, I’ve got to face the loss
Let these shattered pieces fall
I am so done

[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that's good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had

[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that's good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had

[Outro]
By the girl I never had
By the girl I never had
By the girl I never had

Inspiration text:

Intro:
Vedin muita oikeaan suuntaan
Mutta kukaan ei vetänyt mua

Verse 1:
Parisuhde on kuin uhkapeli
Olisi pitänyt arvata etukäteen
Mun olisi pitänyt puolustautuu kun kärsin
Mun olisi pitänyt nähdä tän läpi

Prechorus 1:
Varastit huomioni turhaan roskaan
Varatit vain mun aikaa

Chorus:
Jäi väliin kaikki ja ei etua mun ajeta
Epäoikeudenmukaisuutta en voi korjata
Pettymykseni vain vahvistuu
Kun katson nuorempia jätkiä

Verse 2:
Kai olin kestokykyni rajoilla jo
Kun keskityin työhön ja yhteiseen elämään
Mieles on kuva
Kun sä petit mua sen kanssa

Prechorus 2:
Mun tarvii hyväksyä menetys
Pakko on kääntää katse tulevaan

Music Video Screenplay Treatment for “Girl I Never Had”

Overall Look & Feel
• Color palette: muted cool tones (teal, slate gray), warm amber accents on skin/practicals, slight desaturation
• Camera: Arri Alexa Mini emulation with vintage 35 mm Cooke lenses @ T1.8—shallow depth of field
• Lighting: low-key, practicals (vintage bulbs, neon tubes), smoke/haze, rim/backlight on performers
• Film stock emulation: Kodak Vision3 500T, fine grain + gentle digital overlay
• Motion & Post: handheld close-ups, slider/dolly moves, occasional dutch tilt in pre-chorus, speed-ramps on guitar hits, soft reverb bloom on vocals, film-burn/lens-flare transitions

Scene Breakdown

    INTRO (0:00–0:15) • Shot A: Extreme close-up on a single acoustic guitar string as it’s plucked; focus shift from string to vibrating wood grain • Pull back (dolly out) to reveal clean electric arpeggio being played by guitarist in an empty industrial loft. • Lighting: one amber practical bulb overhead, teal-tinted fill from side window; light haze to catch rays. • Sound supremely tight: each note pops; slight speed-ramp on final arpeggio strike leading into Verse 1.

Alternative Option:
– Instead of loft, use a dimly lit basement with exposed brick, neon tube casting teal glow.

2. VERSE 1 (0:15–0:45)
Intercut between:
A. Vocalist at a small wooden bar table
• Composition: handheld close-up, shallow DOF on face/empty glass/scattered handwritten lyric sheets
• Lighting: single amber Edison bulb overhead, smoke swirling in back, muted gray environment
• Mood: isolation, regret
B. Flashback silhouettes of “her”
• Soft focus, warm backlight; no facial details—only outline of woman smiling or brushing hair
• Tones warmer (golden rim light) to contrast present coldness

Alternative Option B:
– Show her legs at barstool, hand flicking lipstick, silhouette of dancing figure in soft focus.

    PRE-CHORUS 1 (0:45–1:00)
    • Rapid intercuts (0.5–1 sec each) between:
    – Drummer hitting kick drum (tight macro lens on foot pedal)
    – Bassist’s fingers walking bass line in deep shadow, rim-lit in amber
    – Vocalist’s profile under a single bare bulb, sweat/gloss on skin
    • Occasional subtle dutch tilt synced on lyric hits (“stolen,” “time returned”)
    • Lighting: strobe-like bursts on snare snaps, brief teal fill flickers

    CHORUS (1:00–1:30)
    A. Full-band performance in same loft
    • Camera on slider/dolly, slow 360° orbit around band
    • Additional strobes (warm amber) on each snare hit to punctuate rhythm
    • Color: slightly more saturated warm skin tones to signify emotional release
    B. Cutaway: slow-motion rain-slick city street at night
    • Neon signs (red, pink, blue) reflected in puddles, a lone figure walking under umbrella
    • Mood: loneliness, longing

Alternative Chorus Cutaway:
– Empty subway platform at night, distant train lights, echoing footsteps.

5. VERSE 2 (1:30–1:55)
• Return to intimate handheld on vocalist in bar interior (now darker, more smoke)
• Memory flash: close-up of broken film frames fluttering in air (visual metaphor for “broken frames”)
• Insert brief POV shot of vocalist reaching toward empty chair, hand trembles

Alternative Memory Flash:
– Super-8 grainy clip (black & white) of woman’s secret smile projected on loft wall.

    PRE-CHORUS 2 (1:55–2:10)
    • Similar to Pre-chorus 1 but intensify lighting contrast (deeper shadows, harsher amber rim)
    • Quick cuts: vocalist’s clenched jaw, drummer’s fast stick rolls, bassist’s foot tapping
    • No dutch tilt this time—steadier build toward chorus.

    CHORUS (2:10–2:40)
    • Repeat full-band orbit performance—add more camera movement (slight handheld shake)
    • Alternate angle: low angle wide-shot through haze, band silhouettes backlit by neon tubes
    • Brief slow-mo of vocalist spinning as lyrics “I just want to get fucked” hit, emotive reverb bloom

    BRIDGE (2:40–3:00)
    A. Super-8–style B&W insert (grainy, scratched edges) of a young couple laughing in sunlit field
    • Stylized memory—soft focus, vintage color removed
    B. Snap back to present: harsh snap-zoom on vocalist’s eyes (shallow DOF), single tear glistening
    • Sound: brief film-burn whoosh transition

Alternative Bridge Vision:
– Flicker of Polaroids spilling on table, each showing happier moments.

9. OUTRO (3:00–3:20)
• Cross-dissolve between:
– Empty industrial loft (lights off, haze lingering)
– Vocalist walking down foggy street at dawn, teal-gray sky, amber streetlights
• Final static shot: neon “Vacancy” sign glowing amber against slate-gray wall
• Let music fade under ambient street hum; gentle film-burn on final frame.

Motion & Post Recap
• Speed-ramps on key guitar arpeggio strikes
• Soft reverb bloom on vocal shots
• Film-burn and lens-flare overlays in transitions
• Grain consistent across all shots

Julkaisen vanhoja kappaleitani yhden päivässä.
Nyt on päivä 12.
On menossa vuoden 2004 sävellykset, jolloin olin 14 vuotias.
Tämä on ensimmäinen kappale, johon soitin alunperin kitaraa itse.
Opettelin juuri silloin soittamaan kitaraa, ja nauhoittaminen oli osa opettelua.
Kappaleet ovat täysin 100% käsin itse sävellettyjä, sanoitettuja ja sovitettuja, mutta ne on remixattu Suno musiikki-tekoälyllä.
Erityisesti tämä kappale vastaa omaa sovitustani, vaikka kuulostaa tekoälyn tekemältä.
