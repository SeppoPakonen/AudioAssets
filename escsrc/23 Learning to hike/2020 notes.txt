		This moment is so important.
		You can tell me about everything.
		I'm always interested in your conversations.
		I like it when you goof around.
		Come and tell me.
		Come and tell me.
		Come and tell me.

		no money
		nothing,
		well maybe a little
		good looks
		no more money from father
		gone are all the old hitting tactics
		when you can't even touch anymore

		I want to waltz with you, woman
		this paradise for you and me

	mornings {
		I think about it in the mornings
		do I always give more to others
		than I get from others?
	}
	sorry but no {
		If I don't get you, it's deadly.
		Demands upset the lover,
		and it's been so fucking long since I last had you in bed.
		The everyday presses on,
		can't afford to be depressed with a diet here.
		We don't have much to be happy about and food makes up for the loss.
		When you can't stand criticism soft,
		a pea is pulled into the nose,
		whose fault is this again?
		If tomorrow we are no longer thin,
		we can still be influenced by the media to continue having sex.
		A natural feeling is made disgusting by the media,
		and someone's company deprives us of profits at our expense.

	hot woman {
		One, two, we go everywhere,
		I can't stay here.
		Cold for me, warm for you, you make the boundaries.
		I still see, I still see what you're doing.
		Just wait, just wait.
		Those legs and the bodysuit, the dress, damn I'm lusting after you.
		Ah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah
		You will not fall in love with me.
		You won't, you won't, you won't ever.
		Those legs and the bodysuit, the dress, damn I'm lusting after you.
		Ah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah
		You will not fall in love with me.
		You won't, you won't, you won't ever.
		These morning erections don't calm my mind. Ah.
		My wet dreams do not merge with your sigh.
		You won't, you won't, you won't sigh.

		Verse 1:
		Look far, the moon is shining.
		I guess I'm not howling, but others can also notice, there are bad ones here.
		Wives went away from being afraid of quick mistakes in life.
		It's hard when you can't figure out solutions in time.

		Chorus:
		I didn't go to town.
		I was just left with the bare scraps of life.
		Once upon a time, there was a one-night stand that is remembered among guys.
		And I didn't want to let the man coming back from the city back into our company.
		It's hard when you can't say a word without the man from the city trying to say something better.

		Verse 2:
		It was a miracle that I woke up in bed and didn't pass out into nature.
		Panic hits me, there are angry shouts in the village as we all messed up the place.
		Well, maybe not, maybe I'm remembering and hearing wrong.
		I found everything where I left it.
		It's hard when your memory fails you at a young age.

		Verse 1:
		You want to borrow some salt again?
		You might need some dick too.
		Our talking is carried on the stairs,
		the old smell of the dark apartment building sticks to the clothes.

		Chorus:
		Sweating skin on skin,
		with you we are no more than sport.
		I look at you, and you are the picture of pleasure.
		Be someone for me to catch.
		
		Bridge:
		Can you forgive all the hurt?
		I want to reconcile the pain unnecessarily.
