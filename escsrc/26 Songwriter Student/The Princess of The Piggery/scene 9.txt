Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 9: Daria runs away again

It's a traditional market day
and the princess wakes up again
as before
for shopping.
Unsuspectingly, Daria examines
what the market merchant has put out,
until she accidentally hears
the conversation of the malevolent merchant's assistant.

ASSISTANT
By the way, have you heard that the prince of our kingdom Simeon has run away from his kingdom to a piggery to prove to his father that he would rather live in the pigpen in the midst of dirt, poverty and mess than in the kingdom where he has everything, what millions dream of.
Unbelievable!
What an ungrateful child.
At least I would do anything if I could live royally for a day.

MERCHANT
Yeah, think about it.
No more arrogant customers and long, exhausting working days,
but just a holiday every day, huh.

ASSISTANT
Yes, and you could do whatever you like, buy all the nice things and get a massage every day and...
The market merchant interrupts the pensive princess,
who stares into the distance and is lost in her own thoughts.

MERCHANT
The market merchant shouts to the princess.
Miss, miss.
Is everything okay?
Do you buy those purchases or just leave them there?
DARIA
Daria says boldly.
I'll take it.
Here you are.
Daria hands the money to the merchant.

NARRATOR
Daria leaves the place shocked by what she heard.
Alarmed, she runs to the piggery and falls to the ground.
After a while, she bursts into tears.

DARIA
How could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.
How could he have been just a servant.
How can he so coldly lie to me about everything.
And still claims to care about me.
I should have guessed there was something wrong here.
Just when everything was too good to be true.
Yeah, and how could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.
Besides, my parents are probably already really worried about me.
They must think I'm dead when I haven't announced anything about myself.
I should have guessed this!

NARRATOR
Daria thinks for a moment.
Then she sits down in a chair and decides to write a farewell letter in which he explains everything.
Proudly, she gathers her things and leaves the letter on the table and closes the door.
