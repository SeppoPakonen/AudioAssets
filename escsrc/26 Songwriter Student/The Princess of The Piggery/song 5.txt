Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 9: Daria runs away again

It's a traditional market day
and the princess wakes up again
as before
for shopping.
Unsuspectingly, Daria examines
what the market merchant has put out,
until she accidentally hears
the conversation of the malevolent merchant's assistant.

ASSISTANT
By the way, have you heard that the prince of our kingdom Simeon has run away from his kingdom to a piggery to prove to his father that he would rather live in the pigpen in the midst of dirt, poverty and mess than in the kingdom where he has everything, what millions dream of.
Unbelievable!
What an ungrateful child.
At least I would do anything if I could live royally for a day.

MERCHANT
Yeah, think about it.
No more arrogant customers and long, exhausting working days,
but just a holiday every day, huh.

ASSISTANT
Yes, and you could do whatever you like, buy all the nice things and get a massage every day and...
The market merchant interrupts the pensive princess,
who stares into the distance and is lost in her own thoughts.

MERCHANT
The market merchant shouts to the princess.
Miss, miss.
Is everything okay?
Do you buy those purchases or just leave them there?
DARIA
Daria says boldly.
I'll take it.
Here you are.
Daria hands the money to the merchant.

NARRATOR
Daria leaves the place shocked by what she heard.
Alarmed, she runs to the piggery and falls to the ground.
After a while, she bursts into tears.

DARIA
How could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.
How could he have been just a servant.
How can he so coldly lie to me about everything.
And still claims to care about me.
I should have guessed there was something wrong here.
Just when everything was too good to be true.
Yeah, and how could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.

SONG 5: Daria's Discovery

DARIA
Besides, my parents are probably already really worried about me.
They must think I'm dead when I haven't announced anything about myself.
I should have guessed this!

NARRATOR
Daria thinks for a moment.
Then she sits down in a chair and decides to write a farewell letter in which he explains everything.
Proudly, she gathers her things and leaves the letter on the table and closes the door.


Summary of the scene 9:
Daria is out shopping at the market when she overhears the malevolent merchant's assistant talking about how the prince of their kingdom, Simeon, had run away to a piggery to prove to his father that he would rather live there in poverty than in the kingdom with his riches. Shocked and alarmed by what she learned, Daria runs to the piggery and falls to the ground in tears, berating herself for not seeing through the lies and realizing her parents must be worried. She decides to write a farewell letter to explain everything, gathers her things, and leaves, closing the door behind her.

Summary of the scene 10:
Simeon is in the middle of a forest, chopping wood and singing with a smile. He reflects on his newfound happiness, which he knows his father would disapprove of. Suddenly, he hears a crash and finds the King of the Night and his secretary looking for him. Simeon quickly hides in a tree, and the king and secretary eventually leave. Simeon jumps down from the tree, relieved, and remembers about the dinner and sauna he planned for Daria. He rushes back to her, realizing how late he is.

Rap song lyrics by Wu Tang Clang, performed by DARIA, MERCHANT and ASSISTANT:
Intro:
DARIA
I'm here at the market today
Lookin' around for something new
As I'm browsin' the goods no doubt
Something strange catches my view

Verse 1:
MERCHANT
Hey miss, what're you lookin' for
Something here you must adore
We got all the things you need
So step inside and take a seat

ASSISTANT
Word on the street has been spread 
The prince has jumped over the bed 
What a foolish child, runnin' out
Away from his golden clout

DARIA
At such news I feel the pinch 
Turns out it's not that's a cinch 
Have to accept what I heard
Realize all I just deferred

Refrain 1:
DARIA
How could I be so blue-eyed
Missin' all those telltale clues
And ignoring all the warning signs
It came back to bite me in due time

Verse 2:
MERCHANT
Miss, go figure it out
Let your mind wander all about
Just think it through and you might find
That it all just leads to one kind

ASSISTANT
One kind of consequence that's dark
The prince ran off for a lark 
He chose this path of his own will 
Prince or no, it's his own debt to fill

DARIA
This sad truth I'm forced to face 
The dream life I once chased 
Vanished all in a moment 
It's all gone; What a commotion!

Refrain 2:
DARIA
How could I be so blue-eyed
Missin' all those telltale clues
And ignoring all the warning signs
It came back to bite me in due time

Bridge:
DARIA
There's such a whole lot more to figure out
This explanation needs a little clout
It's kind of risqu√© if I just bide
But at least now my doubts subside

Chorus:
DARIA
No more blue-eyed blues
My life I can finally choose
Forget all that bad news
Time now to see the good use

Outro:
DARIA
No more blue-eyed blues
My life I can finally choose
Forget all that bad news
Time now to see the good use.
