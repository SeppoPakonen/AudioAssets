Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 9: Daria runs away again

It's a traditional market day
and the princess wakes up again
as before
for shopping.
Unsuspectingly, Daria examines
what the market merchant has put out,
until she accidentally hears
the conversation of the malevolent merchant's assistant.

ASSISTANT
By the way, have you heard that the prince of our kingdom Simeon has run away from his kingdom to a piggery to prove to his father that he would rather live in the pigpen in the midst of dirt, poverty and mess than in the kingdom where he has everything, what millions dream of.
Unbelievable!
What an ungrateful child.
At least I would do anything if I could live royally for a day.

MERCHANT
Yeah, think about it.
No more arrogant customers and long, exhausting working days,
but just a holiday every day, huh.

ASSISTANT
Yes, and you could do whatever you like, buy all the nice things and get a massage every day and...
The market merchant interrupts the pensive princess,
who stares into the distance and is lost in her own thoughts.

MERCHANT
The market merchant shouts to the princess.
Miss, miss.
Is everything okay?
Do you buy those purchases or just leave them there?
DARIA
Daria says boldly.
I'll take it.
Here you are.
Daria hands the money to the merchant.

NARRATOR
Daria leaves the place shocked by what she heard.
Alarmed, she runs to the piggery and falls to the ground.
After a while, she bursts into tears.

DARIA
How could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.
How could he have been just a servant.
How can he so coldly lie to me about everything.
And still claims to care about me.
I should have guessed there was something wrong here.
Just when everything was too good to be true.
Yeah, and how could I be so blue-eyed and stupid.

SONG 5: Daria's Discovery

DARIA
Besides, my parents are probably already really worried about me.
They must think I'm dead when I haven't announced anything about myself.
I should have guessed this!

NARRATOR
Daria thinks for a moment.
Then she sits down in a chair and decides to write a farewell letter in which he explains everything.
Proudly, she gathers her things and leaves the letter on the table and closes the door.


Summary of the scene 9:
Daria is out shopping at the market when she overhears the malevolent merchant's assistant talking about how the prince of their kingdom, Simeon, had run away to a piggery to prove to his father that he would rather live there in poverty than in the kingdom with his riches. Shocked and alarmed by what she learned, Daria runs to the piggery and falls to the ground in tears, berating herself for not seeing through the lies and realizing her parents must be worried. She decides to write a farewell letter to explain everything, gathers her things, and leaves, closing the door behind her.

Summary of the scene 10:
Simeon is in the middle of a forest, chopping wood and singing with a smile. He reflects on his newfound happiness, which he knows his father would disapprove of. Suddenly, he hears a crash and finds the King of the Night and his secretary looking for him. Simeon quickly hides in a tree, and the king and secretary eventually leave. Simeon jumps down from the tree, relieved, and remembers about the dinner and sauna he planned for Daria. He rushes back to her, realizing how late he is.

Rap song lyrics by Bloodhoung Gang, performed by DARIA, MERCHANT and ASSISTANT:
Intro:
DARIA
In the market I went, what I heard shocked me to the core 
I heard the merchant and assistant yapping like a shoal

Verse 1:
DARIA
Going back and forth I heard their intel
My curious mind forced me to discover the details
Said something about a prince of the kingdom an ungrateful child
That was seriously juicy I must have sounded wild

MERCHANT
Shocking it's true, how ungrateful and bold
Deserves a proper reprimand for acting so cold

ASSISTANT
But to live the life of royalty the creme de la creme
He doesn't know what he's missing or the joys it could bring

Chorus:
DARIA
How could I be so naive and so blind
He didn't tell me anything it all was in my mind
My curiosity rose up there's no turning back
The game is all about joys don't carry no slack

Verse 2:
DARIA
My parents must be worried by now and scared
I need to let them know what I have dared
So I wrote a letter, gathered my things and I was gone
Out of my home, off to the piggery I had to be drawn

MERCHANT
Here take it and run now, none of this will harm you 
Bravely face the world and all the things it can do 

ASSISTANT
Also find joys and riches, forget the prince of the kingdom quick
And don't forget the joys that make life so thick

Chorus:
DARIA
How could I be so naive and so blind
He didn't tell me anything it all was in my mind
My curiosity rose up there's no turning back
The game is all about joys don't carry no slack

Bridge:
A life full of joys is far away and distant
To reach it you have to make an instant
Don't worry no more and dare to do
Cos all your dreams will come true

Outro:
DARIA
Though I had been so blind and naïve
My curiosity rewarded me with joys so dense
It’s time to follow my destiny, yes I know
It’s time to go and overcome the show 

All
It’s time to go and overcome the show!

Rap song (like Without Me) lyrics by Eminem , performed by DARIA, MERCHANT and ASSISTANT:
MERCHANT
Come on in, gotta shop if you care
High quality, way above all other wear
ASSISTANT
No way, all these tales can't be true
But the market merchant's what we got for you 
DARIA
Soaring high, taking a glance
Feeling the power in my hands
They remain silent, I'm too aware 
I heard the words, my fate, alas, I must bear 

CHORUS 
Without me, the princess of the pigg'ry
Without me, the kingdom's lost its way
Without me, the story isn't complete
Without me, that's all people will say 

DARIA 
The truth is, I must disappear 
Must face the things I fear 
Trust no one, heartbroken so 
This story now, shall end with a wo 

CHORUS 
Without me, the princess of the pigg'ry
Without me, the kingdom's lost its way
Without me, the story isn't complete
Without me, that's all people will say 

Out of the pigpen, the king of the night
Tried to search, I gave them a fight 
With
























 
Rap song lyrics by Eminem, performed by DARIA, MERCHANT and ASSISTANT:

Verse 1:
MERCHANT:
Hey miss! What's your desire?
Come take a look at my market stall and see what I provide
ASSISTANT:
It's shocking the news I just heard, it seems our prince has fled
Living in the pigpen, yeah, and wishing he was dead
DARIA:
My jaw dropped in surprise, what's the truth behind this story?
To run away and live life as a poor man's glory?
ASSISTANT:
It's true, the prince chose this way,
But there's another choice to make,
Leave it all behind or be in poverty's wake

Chorus:
NARRATOR
For the princess of the pigg'ry,
Learn the lesson from the story
One man's gold can be another's sorrow
But if you listen to the moral,
You will find your own tomorrow
So never take things for granted 'til your future is in view
'Cause the princess of the pigg'ry knows what might come for you

Verse 2:
MERCHANT:
There's lessons to learn, don't be so blind
Tough ones to learn but you got to be kind
ASSISTANT:
Poverty isn't something to choose,
stay away and you don't lose
DARIA:
But you can't ignore it's secrets and lies,
when it's real it shows you the prize
ASSISTANT:
So make the right decision your new aim,
'cause in this life you will never be the same

Chorus:
NARRATOR
For the princess of the pigg'ry,
Learn the lesson from the story
One man's gold can be another's sorrow
But if you listen to the moral,
You will find your own tomorrow
So never take things for granted 'til your future is in view
'Cause the princess of the pigg'ry knows what might come for you

Bridge:
NARRATOR
She grabbed a pen and wrote her goodbye
Go live in the piggery or own the sky
Take action and don't fear the unknown
She felt the freedom of her own throne
DARIA
I will be brave, no matter what happens
Life never stops, the future is coming

Outro:
DARIA
My fate awaits me, I must face it
Whatever comes I'm ready for this mission
Courage will take me to freedom's shore,
where I'll stay for evermore
So never take things for granted 'til your future is in view
'Cause the princess of the pigg'ry knows what might come for you!









Lyrics by Eminem:
Verse 1:
I'm out shopping for dinner, I'm getting kinda curious
The merchants and their assistants, their talk is like the news
I hear them singing their songs, the music velvety smooth
I listen to their stories, here's what they have to prove

Chorus:
My heart is wide open, I'm ready to learn
Ready to find out if what I heard is true
I'm looking for answers, oh, and what makes it worse
Is the gossip of the locals, Daria's Discovery

Verse 2:
All the lights, things they said, all they spoke of
My sense of wonderment awakens, my curiosity's aloft
So, I wander through the crowds 'cause I'm on a mission for truth
The seed of hope reigns in my heart, awaiting what I'll discover soon

Chorus:
My heart is wide open, I'm ready to learn
Ready to find out if what I heard is true
I'm looking for answers, oh, and what makes it worse
Is the gossip of the locals, Daria's Discovery

Bridge:
I'm not searching 'cause I'm lonely
It's just the feeling that I have to move
I'm trying to fly away now, I'm gonna take off, whoa, whoa

Chorus:
My heart is wide open, I'm ready to learn
Ready to find out if what I heard is true
I'm looking for answers, oh, and what makes it worse
Is the gossip of the locals, Daria's Discovery
