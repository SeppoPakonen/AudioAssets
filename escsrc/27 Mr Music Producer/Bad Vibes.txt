Title: Bad Vibes


[Verse 1]
Cause, babe, I thought we were meant to be
But now Im lost, I cant break free
We never competed, just one team,
My heart in a bind, but you are my dream.

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh,  it's so hard to
Think about the love we had
You and I

[Chorus]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.

[Verse 2]
Remember  when you thought our bond would break,
Remember how I proved you wrong, for my own sake,
It was my war, a battle fought every day
Battle won, scars remain, but peace here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh,  it's so hard to
Think about the love we had
You and I

[Chorus]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.

[Instrumental] 

[Chorus]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.

[Outro]

[End]

[Chorus 1]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
So listen here, baby girl, messin' with my mind

[Verse 1]
Cause, babe, I thought we were meant to be
But now Im lost, I cant break free
We never competed, just one team,
My heart in a bind, but you are my dream.
Now in this moment, things reach a peak,
I dont wanna fight, but I'm tired of being meek
These  beats from dark depths, tryna replace you
Take time and erase you, love's in desperate view
No, never backing down
Better spread your wings and take that crown

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh,  it's so hard to
Think about the love we had
You and I

[Chorus 2]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
So, slow down and take a breath
Cause, baby, now we're out of step, hey!
Now the flames are rising,
And I won't flee, we'll keep on fighting
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.

[Verse 2]
Remember  when you thought our bond would break,
Remember how I proved you wrong, for my own sake,
Dont  you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Fast forwards to the future, never looking back, ya
It was my war, a battle fought every day
Battle won, scars remain, but peace here to stay
Stabbed in the back; trust destroyed, but I'll forgive
Still, all my life, I'll learn to live and let live
And we'll pick up the pieces, leave the past in the dust now

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh,  it's so hard to
Think about the love we had
You and I

[Chorus 2]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
So, slow down and take a breath
Cause, baby, now we're out of step, hey!
Now the flames are rising,
And I won't flee, we'll keep on fighting
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.

[Instrumental] 

[Chorus 2]
Cause, honey, now we got some bad vibes,
You know we used to be one in a million kind.
So, slow down and take a breath
Cause, baby, now we're out of step, hey!
Now the flames are rising,
And I won't flee, we'll keep on fighting
You, my darling, were once my happy ending,
But now we're stuck in this endless cycle of mending.
