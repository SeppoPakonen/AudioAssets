[Verse 1]
You got me on fire, I can't control my desire
But when I'm with you, baby, it feels like we touchin' the wire
Got me feeling some type of way, can't even speak
With your body movin' like that, you got me weak

[Chorus]
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight

[Verse 2]
With each kiss I'll light you up
Won't stop 'til you're begging for my touch
You want it real bad, you want it real good
I'll give it to you rough, just like you should

[Chorus]
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight

[Verse 3]
We know it's risky, but baby, that's the thrill
Let's write our own story, let's make it real.
Lost in your touch, forgettin' all the rules
Ain't nothin' wrong with bein' a little reckless like fools

[Chorus]
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight

Your my queen tonight
Your my queen tonight
Your my queen tonight

[Twist]
Can't see love comin', it's a mystery
Just another stranger, tempting with her sinful history
You got me feelin' wild and free, ridin' me like a roller coaster
But these doubts and questions, got me feelin' like a poser

[Chorus]
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight
You got me in your grip, got me right
Can't resist, your my queen tonight

Your my queen tonight
Your my queen tonight
Your my queen tonight
