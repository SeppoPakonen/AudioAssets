Verse 1:
As I walked through the city lights
I knew this was where I belonged,
this is where my heart could take flight. 
my small town dreams finally coming true.
And as I wandered around,
exploring my new home, I found my tribe,
my people, where I no longer felt alone.
Lost in the bright lights,
I found my home in the chaos,

Chorus:
With these strangers turned family,
I feel like I've found my true home,
where my heart is free.
With each step I take on these
familiar streets,
I know I'll never feel alone,
this city's heartbeat, my soul will always greet.

Verse 2:
Every corner I turn, every face I meet,
I feel alive with every beat.
Exploring this small city together,
discovering new wonders and never wanting to leave.
Every moment in this city feels like a dream,
I never want to wake up and leave.
(With) each passing day, these streets become more familiar to me,
the bonds we've formed, unbreakable and free.

Chorus:
With these strangers turned family,
I feel like I've found my true home,
where my heart is free.
With each step I take on these
familiar streets,
I know I'll never feel alone,
this city's heartbeat, my soul will always greet.

Bridge:
With each passing day, this city feels like home,
a love that only continues to grow.
Our hearts beat in tune, a rhythm so sweet,
together we've found, a sense of completeness.

Every moment in this city feels like home
my heart won't resist, it already chose

Chorus:
With these strangers turned family,
I feel like I've found my true home,
where my heart is free.
With each step I take on these
familiar streets,
I know I'll never feel alone,
this city's heartbeat, my soul will always greet.

Outro:
we've found a sense of completeness.
strangers and friends
familiar streets,
I know I'll never feel alone
