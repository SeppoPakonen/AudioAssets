My tears fall like snow
san. Laura Timonen, Seppo Pakonen

[Verse 1]
In this little town, ain't much to see
You were my everything, my destiny
But Christmas, oh it brings both joy and pain
As I see the lonely, wishing for love to reign
60 years of love, can't compare
The heartache I feel, without you here
And then I'll toast to the memories we've shared
Christmas cheer and love, beyond compare

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Remember frosty nights, chasing stars above
But you were my forever, my one true love

[Verse 1]
And on this silent night, my tears fall like snow
Wishing you'd come back, but you'll never know
On Christmas day, the lights shine bright
But without you, it's just a lonely night

[Chorus 2]
Wishin' I could go back in time
To nights when we were young and in our prime
With each step I take, memories come to mind
All the love we left, but it's not hard to find

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Remember frosty nights, chasing stars above
But you were my forever, my one true love

[Verse 1]
And on this silent night, my tears fall like snow
Wishing you'd come back, but you'll never know
On Christmas day, the lights shine bright
But without you, it's just a lonely night

[Bridge]
Dreamin' of a white Christmas with you
Our love, pure and true

[Verse 1]
And on this silent night, my tears fall like snow
Wishing you'd come back, but you'll never know
On Christmas day, the lights shine bright
But without you, it's just a lonely night
