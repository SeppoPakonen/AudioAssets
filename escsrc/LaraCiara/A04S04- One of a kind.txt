[Verse 1]
I was just a side dish, never meant to be your wife
You craved my body, but not my heart or life

From the first kiss, I knew you were the one
You moved me honey, with every beat and drum

Do you wanna try again, my love?
Nothin' else would matter, we could rise above

You showed me love in mysterious ways
Now I'm the realest, love ain't just a phase

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So let the river run, or run for your life
Either way, we'll find peace in the strife

[Chorus]
With you by my side, I have no fear
Be my valentine, every year

We tear each other apart, but we always find
Our way back to love, it's one of a kind

Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
one of a kind

[Verse 2]
With you, I feel complete and whole
Our love story, never gets old

The effort it takes, you have no clue
But for this love, I'll do anything for you

We never planned it, but look where we are now
In each other's arms, lovin' like we don't know how.

Take my hand, let's chase the lightning in the sky
Our love is electric, we'll never say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Together we dance in the storm
Our love, a beautiful chaos, we'll never conform

[Chorus]
With you by my side, I have no fear
Be my valentine, every year

We tear each other apart, but we always find
Our way back to love, it's one of a kind

Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
one of a kind

[Bridge]
From the ashes, we rise, a love reborn
Shining like a flashlight, one love, one form

In moments of doubt, our love always shines
Babe, you the one, blowin' my mind every time

[Chorus]
With you by my side, I have no fear
Be my valentine, every year

We tear each other apart, but we always find
Our way back to love, it's one of a kind

With you by my side, I have no fear
Be my valentine, every year

We tear each other apart, but we always find
Our way back to love, it's one of a kind

Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
Our love is one of a kind
one of a kind
