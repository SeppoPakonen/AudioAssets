Verse 1:
I have loved you a thousand years
I'll see a love you feel
I'll do anything for you
But you don't seem to notice
Do you think of me every day
When you walked away
Was I only fool for your loving

Chorus:
Now watch when I walk away
'Cos my heartache won't go away
I'll do anything for you
But you don't care about it
Are you afraid of love
Why can't you see what's above
I'll do anything for you
But you don't care about it
