It's for the video blog
It's in the voice
power and technology
practicality arises when writing a manuscript
is in the picture
technology and practicality
but no power
the motive for producing is found in the joy of doing
but there is no motive for publishing, which affects the content of the manuscript, i.e. the practicality of the end result
the image can be made more effective by cutting and using simple effects
however, the biggest efficiency effect comes from the host, who should dress correctly
which clothes would you choose yourself?
if you were the furthest away from "yourself" when you were naked, what clothes would you wear then?


What makes Poko laugh? {
	Contrasting and Unexpected Elements {
		{
			Today's excessive posing for the camera on social media is absolutely crazy.
			But it's so much fun!
		}
		{
			You make sexy pictures even if you're not interested.
			It's like softly raping yourself.
		}
		{
			You want to relax tonight and just go for one drink.
			But you know you still take pictures...
			So you have to put on makeup and choose an outfit.
