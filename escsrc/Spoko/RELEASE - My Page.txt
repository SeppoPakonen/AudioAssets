Her online followers will share and hit the like button
She is a social queen, a likeable machine
No secrets can be kept, not everything stays perfect
She'll post her pic again, will efforts be in vain?

She comes to my page
She captivates my soul
She comes to my page
And she gets me to follow

Provocative statements creating misconnect
Her little diversion kills all the assertion
As reels that go viral, clickbaiting is vital
A constant need for more, the internet's a bore

She comes to my page
She captivates my soul
She comes to my page
And she gets me to follow

She has been copying content, taking the shortcut
The algorithm won't care
She has been posing for us, getting her clothes off
Because the payer is the man

She comes to my page
She captivates my soul
She comes to my page
And she gets me to follow
She comes to my page
She comes to my page
She comes to my page
And she gets me to follow
