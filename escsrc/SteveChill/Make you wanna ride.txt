[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
 
[Verse 1]
On a Friday night, twerkin' like it's a sport
Everybody tryna get on my level, but they fallin' short
You in bad shape, I'm the weight loss
can't keep up, you lost in my sauce
You tryna be a ride or die
But I won't let you kill my vibe
No fear, just lust burning bright
Your hottie body, my untamed delight
So if you want it, go all in
Ain't no shame, baby, let your freak flag spin
Ain't no shame in my game, gettin' my top off
Showin' you what I got, ain't nothin' to scoff at
You just wanna bump, but I'll rock your whole world
On top of my throne, my power is unfurled

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride

[Verse 2]
I run towards danger, it's where I feel alive
They can label me reckless, but I'll always thrive
Tattoo your name on me, leave a permanent scar
Can't deny this love, it's who we are
Got that fire, can't put it out, I'm dangerous
Wanna feel the rush, you gotta be courageous
I ain't playin' games, got you on lock down
In this love game, you the king, I'm the crown

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride

[Bridge]
I'm all in, no more hiding behind
These casual clothes, showin' you what's on my mind
Bounce that ass, make me wanna confess
Titties bouncing, you got me feeling blessed

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride



















[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride

Showin' you what I got, ain't nothin' to scoff at
You just wanna bump, but I'll rock your whole world
On top of my throne, my power is unfurled
Cause we gon blow boy, pop that thang
Got laid by a young bordello, no shame

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs

Wanna feel the rush, you gotta be courageous
I ain't playin' games, got you on lock down
In this love game, you the king, I'm the crown
You never even know, but now it's clear
We were in a weird place, you caused my fear
Don't need love, just wanna be your rider
Don't need words, show me how you desire
My haters get wild, but they still ain't shit
Pussy so fire, even wives can't resist
I don't need a man, I'll make it on my own
'Cause I'm back on my stunna shit, fully grown

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride

[Bridge]
Keep me coming back for more, baby you got me begging for more
And maybe it's just fate, that we're a match made in heaven's door
I'm all in, no more hiding behind
These casual clothes, showin' you what's on my mind
Bounce that ass, make me wanna confess
Titties bouncing, you got me feeling blessed
Struttin' my stuff, feeling like a boss
But when I'm with you, I melt like hot sauce

[Chorus]
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Make you wanna ride
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
Got me losin' my mind, you do
Keep on, wantin' more of you
Big booty and thick thighs
Make you wanna ride
