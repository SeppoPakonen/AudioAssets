Package: Timeline

Purpose
- Aggregates year folders and album packages via `Timeline.upp` â†’ `uses` list.
- Serves as navigation/index in TheIDE for the creative archive.

Conventions
- Update the `uses` list when adding new years (e.g., `2026`) or album packages (e.g., `13 New Title`).
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` present and listed first in the `.upp` file for visibility.
- Do not rename year or album directories without reviewing downstream tools and references.

Tasks
- See `CURRENT_TASK.md` here and `/CURRENT_TASK.md` at repo root for current focus.
