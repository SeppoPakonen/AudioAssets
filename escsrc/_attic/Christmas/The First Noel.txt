[Verse 1]
The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay tending their sheep,
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 2]
They lookèd up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 3]
And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 4]
This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Over Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 5]
Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie;
One entered it them for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 6]
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 7]
Between an ox stall and an ass,
This Child truly there He was;
For want of clothing they did Him lay
All in a manger, among the hay.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 8]
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heav’nly Lord;
That hath made Heav’n and earth of naught,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

[Verse 9]
If we in our time shall do well,
We shall be free from death and hell;
For God hath prepared for us all
A resting place in general.

[Refrain]
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.
