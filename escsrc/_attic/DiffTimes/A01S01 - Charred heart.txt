### V3 ###
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how I really feel
But my mind's on spin and my heart won't heal

You had me open, but you closed the door
Now I'm left standing, my heart on the floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You once told me, you believed in me

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

[Verse 2]
With a 'howdy' and a smile, you took me to the moon
In your eyes, I fell in love way too soon

Mind empty, no words to say
You fill it up, in every single way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Every second with you is worth the creatin'

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

[Bridge]
I may be drunk, but my   heart speaks true
It beats only for you, no one else will do

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

[Outro]
I may be drunk, but my heart speaks true
It beats only for you, no one else will do
I may be drunk, but my heart speaks true
It beats only for you, no one else will do

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free







### V2 ###
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how I really feel
But my mind's on spin and my heart won't heal

I lose myself in her wild ways
A beautiful girl, a temptation I can't resist

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You once told me, you believed in me,
Therefore I'll hold on, to that smile I see.

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred

[Verse 2]
With a 'howdy' and a smile, she took me to the moon
In her eyes, I fell in love way too soon

Mind empty, no words to say
You fill it up, in every single way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We just wanna have fun, no need for waitin'
Every second with you is worth the creatin'

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred

[Bridge]
I may be drunk, but my heart speaks true
It beats only for you, no one else will do


[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred










### V1 ###
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how I really feel
But my mind's on spin and my heart won't heal

I lose myself in her wild ways
A beautiful girl, a temptation I can't resist

You had me open, but you closed the door
Now I'm left standing, my heart on the floor

With just one look, she stole my soul
Now I pray, to make her my own

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You once told me, you believed in me,
Therefore I'll hold on, to that smile I see.

Pushing through pain, into the unknown
To break free, I'll stand on my own

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred

[Verse 2]
With a 'howdy' and a smile, she took me to the moon
In her eyes, I fell in love way too soon

Mind empty, no words to say
You fill it up, in every single way

She wanna suck on me, but I'm a dreamer
I see beauty in her, she's my redeemer

I got you covered, baby, wherever you wanna go
Just say the word and we'll put on a show

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Like a drug, you keep me coming back
Can't resist, you're my sweet love attack

We just wanna have fun, no need for waitin'
Every second with you is worth the creatin'

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred

[Bridge]
I may be drunk, but my heart speaks true
It beats only for you, no one else will do

Body trembling in pleasure, through this pain
With you, my rebel love will forever reign

[Chorus 1]
Wishin', prayin', that you'll come back to me
But I'll move on, love myself, finally free

Gotta let you go, but it's so hard
Can't help but hold on, my heart charred

[Chorus 2]
She had me waiting, yearning for her touch
Then she stole my heart, I couldn't resist much

You only show me love when we're skin to skin
But I can't help but let you in again and again
