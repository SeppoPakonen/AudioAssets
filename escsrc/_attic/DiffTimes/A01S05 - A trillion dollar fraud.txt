[Verse 1]
Tearing up my world with your twisted lies
And dancing in the ruins, we'll both pay the price
Cause I can't see the future and you can't change the past,
But we still hold on to a sliver of hope that this won't be our last

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The struggle for survival just gets harder by the day
With every step forward, we seem to lose our way
We ignored the signs and warning bells, now we're paying for our ignorance

[Chorus 1]
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade
a trillion dollar fraud
a trillion dollar fraud

[Verse 2]
All the talks we used to have, they meant nothing in the end
All the promises you made, they were just a means to pretend
Cause I can't feel forgiveness, and you can't feel remorse
But we both keep on pretending, this won't end in divorce

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The scars on my heart, they refuse to heal
With every new wound, I'm reminded of how it feels
We had a future, now all we have is a past full of regrets

[Chorus 2]
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade
a trillion dollar fraud
a trillion dollar fraud
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade

[Bridge 1]
The fear of what's to come looms heavy in the air
With every breath, I feel the weight of despair
We were foolish to believe that forever was within our control.

[Chorus 2]
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade
Standing  at the edge of a crumbling facade
a trillion dollar fraud
