Song 1: Saint or devil

Verse 1:
I dyed my hair black
and I collected the scraps of my ego
I painted the eyes dark
and I woke up to a new reality

Chorus:
Saint or devil
Permission is to be different
When I fall, I don't stay lying on the ground anymore
Saint or devil
I became a different woman now
One day you will have to settle scores with me

Verse 2:
Too much kindness is deadly
It makes you forget yourself
when everyone can do what they want to the saint at any time
When you dare to go into the dark
The devil makes shadows come alive
When you get to know yourself, it makes you reborn

Bridge:
I finally release my power
It tears these shackles from my wrists
I don't cry after you, I don't cry after you
I don't cry after you, I don't want you anymore
I'm finally letting go of my demons
They say you should never be so kind
You're not crying after me, I'm not crying after you
I don't cry for you, I don't want you anymore




Song 2: Roadtrip

Intro:
Let's go on a journey to dreams.
Can I hold tight, hold my hand on your thigh while you sit next to me?

Verse 1:
Driving across Finland by car
Just alone with you
The summer vacation starts today
Finally we start living
Fill up your car with Shell
Cold drinks are packed in a bag
The navigator shows the direction to Kokkola
From there we can continue anywhere

Chorus:
You hold your hand on my thigh
I look at you with my side eye
It's a road trip to dreams
When I can be in you
I'm holding on to you
I'm holding on to you

Verse 2:
You have cute hair and eyes
And hands too tightly on the wheel
I can taste the coke on your lips
I want to kiss you even more
In the evening we stop
And we end up at a cheap motel
The landscape is covered by a garbage canopy
But I can sleep under your arm

Bridge:
We continue from Pietarsaari to Vaasa
I hope this journey never ends
I could ride with you all summer long
And everyday life would never catch up with us again
