In the beginning you walk towards your destination.
You're walking somewhere at sunset direction.
Route is blocked by mountains and gorges.
You will pass the mountains, because it would be quite foolish to climb up and come back down.
Especially when the destination is waiting.
Sometimes you encounter a ravine, and you must get the other side.
You descend the ravine slopes, and you look at the other side looking for a route there.
Sooner or later, you step wrong and you hit the bottom of the gorge.
Fall does not hurt, because the walls are soft as pillows.
And from the bottom you will find all the things you've always dreamed of.
Even if you're trying to get away and climb up the slope, you will fall down.
Eventually you will no longer try to escape, and you accept things as they are.

What makes Poko laugh? {
	Absurd concept {
		As a child, you don't understand what it's like to live for ten years.
		As a child, I saw the future as a sunset.
		As an adult, death is noon because I know clearly what is happening.
		
		Life is a metaphor, where at the end you get stuck.
		You look for a woman, you get stuck with it.
		Or worse, you break up, and you're stuck alone.
	}
	Playful Interaction with God {
		God put a gorge in the middle so that you would recognize that you are closer to death.
		You don't take unnecessary risks, like conquering mountains.
	}
	Self-Deprecating Humor {
		The little Rosie inside me looks at the world with bright red sunglasses.
	}
	Irony {
		Every day I try to feel that something new is happening, even though I repeat the same pattern.
		Life is boring if it fits into a metaphor.
	}
	Playful Wordplay {
		I was in a hurry to be stuck. I would have had time to conquer one mountain in between.
		At least I didn't walk in this direction when I set off.
		Sometimes you meet others on the way, and end up in a bar.
		Wrong order. Here at the bottom of the gorge, these dreams are someone else's.

	Absurd and Exaggerated Scenarios {
		{
			I was on a lonely journey.
			I was only thinking about the reward.
			I didn't notice that people were missing.
		}
	}
	Satirical Observations {
		{
			I trust a little too much in the future, and that the destination will reward.
		}
	}
	Dark Humor {
		{
			My friend didn't even start when I did because he was waiting for the advance payment.
		}
		{
			I dreamed of friends who understand me the way I am.
			Men like me are still hated.
			The tradition that a man takes care of money is cruel.
			They always choose a reason to hate.
			A man without money is a failure.
		}
		{
			What's the deal between walking on an adventure track and making dreams come true?
			Seems like a bad business strategy.
		}
	}
	Casual and Conversational Tone {
		{
			Okay, I went to school and did what I was told, and at work I made money.
			I raised the kids and paid for the house.
			Now I have cancer and I'm dying.
			I didn't notice the mistake.
		}
		{
			I had always wanted a profession.
			I dreamed of nothing but work.
			Now I'm at work, but nothing else seems right.
		}
		{
			Were there other paths that could have been taken.
			Did I believe the school and their advice too much.
			I notice that the information comes from a centralized inner circle.

Explicit erotic novel:

Nina was walking along the winding path, the moon reflecting its pale light on her face. She paused in the possible route and looked up while contemplating the grandiose mountain peaks that were silhouetted against the night sky, dreaming of the adventures that could be found in the steep drop-offs and rolling hillsides. In the silent rock pool ahead of her, Nina shivered. It was mysterious and overcome with an invisible potential – could she defy her fate and find freedom and love?

Continuing through the winding path, Nina looked up and saw a stake in the mounting slope. Pulling her courage together she grabbed the stake tightly and dragged it through the ground to prop her up. As sweat cascaded down her forehead and cobwebs, her heart raced wildly beating out of its chest. What had she stumbled upon that was swept away into the shadows of the past?

Nina groaned softly as she reached the edge and carefully pulled herself over the lip. Now facing the daring roll off downwards, she closed her eyes and leaned into the murkiness. Following her instinct, she continued to slide inch by inch, exploring the hidden boulders and plants cradled inside the gaps. Finally reaching the bottom of the slope, the first rays of sunlight emerged just as she noticed something additional…was she dreaming? Right there beside a rock wall, erect and confident between two oak trees, a man stood with his arms open ready to be touched and tamed.

Nina could barely they could hardly breathe, as he spoke gentle words in a husky mannered drawl. His muscular body was hunched, and his luminescent face made her believe he could absorb and relent or dispel any perceived darkness in an everlasting pace. The passion of their encounter framed by the rocks quickly tugged at Nina's controlled lust. His eyes glinting like sparkles under moonlight, throwing Nina down onto the ground and mingling feather soft touches on her arms with fiery stern kisses, felt everything up and consume the universe that had become her fate.

Much later, she lay in innocence with eyes burning and legs aching, yet with him firmly holding her until the final moments. Modesty would never have been attainable after surviving memories of his bare and smooth skin craved, rich fantasies entwined into pillared pandemonium, and bliss proclaimed - atening flames and thunderous wills, beautifuling orgasmic dividends — never forgotten. 

The aftermath of what happened nagged vastly her new world, carefree spirit that spilled realizations where heartstorm cloud withheld angry temperament mixed with desireless sway. Yet this wasn't the fearful journey, captive so unlike the transient that had connected best devoured lady while relieved solemn bliss had continued for eternity. Before too long when life returned them the mementos of trysted rhapsody turned to choices of desperation where grace rejoined that intense, severe and demonic wet milky white way, divine feelings stirred to sleep again until the meadow next come near spiritual imbeded transience within grasp tangible gait, eventually trumping depths, eternity rounded forever repeat and balance derived waighting until relief awaken new echoes the wild light grew nurtured near vine's redemptive on twilight faders moaning heartbounds infused around sentress goodness of note. The bottom area end!


Rap song of the novel: 

Verse 1

Nina walking down a winding path way, moonshine shinin' like its here to stay
Think on potential, in her dreams she delay
Stumbles of something dark, entrapped in reverie
Brave enough to take risk, yeah let danger proceed
Dig her feet in this blessed spot land of mystery
Parigoros cross the ocean near by to her feet

Chorus 

Below, much deeper from the sky ever fade away
She breaths quick, mesmerized so lustful in hearthearted pale
Drags her body on a natural madding springy hay in river gloom 
To keep pushing of dream dreams she carry 'round for them blended twined pairs
Grow sweetly round of safe embrace while controlling her fate
Falling slippy what something spirit breathed vainly outside beastview's limited grace 
Arrive in heartfelt where edge reach relieve redeem result suprise burgeon hopeful found with endless trade

Verse 2

Candy eyes glint just like the grass, pure moonbeam green mist low'd wispingmass
Body entwined spun to fall world lotus bed
King of victors waves swollen waves shrivling underround from east pressed
Golden mansion raised to submit lifelong swaddle in seen path channelers feast
Heart shed beaten down in revealing bliss she grieve cold 'n exhaust much time weep 
Retriving nightly shame between damp fragrant

Chorus 

Below, much deeper from the sky ever fade away 
She breaths quick, mesmerized so lustful in hearthearted pale 
Drags her body on a natural madding springy hay in river gloom 
To keep pushing of dream dreams she carry 'round for them blended twined pairs 
Grow sweetly round of safe embrace while controlling her fate 
Falling slippy what something spirit breathed vainly outside beastview's limited grace 
Complete he fleeting halo heart tucked pure reached secret points gone deep gleamed awaken silenced sky for turning grace, we journey lest nothing awaits but an emergency of trust..and the bottom is the unforeseen fairytale, never forgotten..change lives expectantly

Bridge 
Even tho dire moments seemed doubly simple
A kiss stuck through the tarnished nightmares spreading courage double total
She threw her dice for smashing bonds wearing grueling semblance
Waiting sly eyed slimming foxes jeered freezing awe for ages spent stun,
A vow thats pledge hidden haven more dearly unseen energy depths enroumed radiance spent..surged.. forever continuous flow promised dream night hold freeing hand.
