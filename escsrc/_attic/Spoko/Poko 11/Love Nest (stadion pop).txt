My name is Poko and I'm an adult looking for a love nest to spend the night in. 

I take the elevator up to the old building and my girlfriend from the love room is already there. 
She has a surprise for me: a treasure spot hidden at her hip that I'm to uncover with my tongue and fingertips. 

I eagerly move my hands and mouth across her skin. I explore every inch of her curves and crevices, devoting my attention to bringing her pleasure. I make sure to not miss a single spot before teasing her with a flicker of my tongue. 

Eventually, she is in a state of bliss and I'm covered in her love. I lay there in the afterglow, feeling content and relieved as the darkness of the night envelopes us.
