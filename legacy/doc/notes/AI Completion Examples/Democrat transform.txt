Deep bias style:
The 90s were a dark time for America, where traditional values and male dominance reigned supreme. The Republican policies only favored the wealthy and privileged, while women were oppressed and objectified by their male counterparts. Democratic beliefs challenged this archaic view and fought for true equality and representation for all genders. Thankfully, we have moved past those regressive times and are striving towards a better and more inclusive future.

Lyrics in original style:
1. Listen to me now, hear me loud, my wife
2. Be quiet, make no sound, no strife
3. I was wrong, so now I'm paying the price
4. Can't undo my mistakes not once, not twice
5. My words for you are full of affection,
6. But you've stopped listening like cut off connection.
7. Lost my trust for you tonight,
8. Colours once so bright, now black and blue.


Same lyrics in deeply biased style:
1. Can you believe this woman, always speaking up and making noise.
2. She should know her place and stay quiet like a good wife.
3. But of course, she blames me for my mistakes, typical.
4. I can never catch a break with these nagging wives.
5. I mean, I do love her, but she just doesn't listen anymore.
6. It's like she's cut off from reality and only cares about herself.
7. And now she's playing the victim, making me out to be the bad guy.
8. But really, she's the one who ruined everything with her drama and emotions.
