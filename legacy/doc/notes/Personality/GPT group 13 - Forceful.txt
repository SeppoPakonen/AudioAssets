Name: Black and White
	Adjectives: Opposite, Contrasting, Different, Similar, Carefree, Disappointed, Peaceful, Relaxed
	Description: The lyrics of this song are written in a more poetic style, contrasting two different lifestyles and mindsets. The first verse introduces the two characters and their respective lifestyles, while the second verse explores the similarities and differences between them. The chorus then brings the two together by emphasising the fact that although they may appear to be very different, they are in fact more than the sum of their parts.

		Verse 1
		A pure angel girl with a black devil.
		A nice boy and a naughty girl.
		It's the same as doing homework again, says the boy in the evening, while the girl is smoking next to him in the playground.
		Someone is playing a new song again, not energetic but a relaxed melody.
		The girl is carefree and she and her friends try drugs.
		The boy wants to continue in peace, just the same course as always before.
		The girl parties and is looking for the right one, she gets disappointments from parties.

		Verse 2
		Both have their reasons when they meet at night.
		They understand each other, one wants the other's life.
		When a girl wants to feel safe and a boy wants something exciting.
		They are similar, but completely different.
		The girl describes herself as kind and tells beautiful stories about her school days.
		A nice boy tells about his bad adventures, without the nice parts.
		The girl thinks things are not bad, when she herself is much worse.
		In the boy's opinion, the boy is not doing well at work at school, he himself is much better.

		Chorus
		When one knows the other at first sight, the other tells about himself, as if about the other's life.
		Black and white, both opposites have mind and life.
		Together they are much more than gray.

		Do you hear the death of a song - it sings to you
		as a visitor in the shadows it sings to me
		it sings us its immortal tune
		to some as a bullet to others as a snake's head
		You can die tomorrow or today,
		so remember each of your friends
		In the midst of snakes, I ask you to understand
		good and bad are inside, hear that voice
		because you rarely hear it and that's a shame
		You never know when the messages will arrive calling the man to death
		For a moment you can hide, wrap yourself in a black veil

		I hope that you will still exist somewhere.
		Did O lose you?
		Was it true?
		I cannot say.
		Scary faces in my dreams.
		Devil faces far as I can see.
		Not one is yours.
		I think it's great,
		but I could use a guide in dark.
		With dark feelings, you just went away.
		I was sorry, 'cos this ain't our day.
		You left me thinking, without good reasons.
		Without waiting, comes the bad nightmare again.
		It tells me, that you will not even care.
		I won't believe it.
		Go eat shit, my partner stays with me.
		I feel and see those things I was afraid.
		I hear those things, what I hate
		I do those things, with them like a bedmate.
		I was in the sea as a small fishbait.

		Our sexy enemies, they don't see us.
		I don't have any money, I'll just watch.
		The price of free meat per kilo is too much for me.
		At the bar, the women need a drink and I pay, but they don't stay to chat with me.
		Girls are looking for handsome men, money and power,
		Their x-ray vision looks at the crotch, looking for men with big penises.
		My love songs haven't worked, not the nightly calls, not the shared laughs.
		If the hottest new thing is to be stylish, then I prefer to belong to the ugly people.
