First, write verses or lines that introduce the main character(s) and their motivations. This can be done through direct statements or through lyrical storytelling:
- "He was just a kid from the streets, trying to make it out alive / With dreams of fortune and fame, he would take any chance to thrive"
- "She was a fighter, raised in a broken home / With a fire in her soul, she refused to be just another statistic"
- "A tale of two brothers, born in the same hood / But one took a dark path, the other stayed true, it's all good"
- "He had a gift for words, a talent for rhyme / But life never gave him a break, no matter how hard he tried"

Next, introduce the main conflict or problem that the character(s) face and develop it further:
- "But the streets ain't kind, they'll chew you up and spit you out / He needed to survive, so he turned to slinging drugs without a doubt"
- "She wanted to escape the pain, to leave it all behind / But the wounds of her past, they lingered in her mind"
- "One brother sold his soul, the other held on to his dreams / They clashed in a war, fueled by jealousy and greed"
- "He poured his heart out in every verse, hoping someone would listen / But all he got was rejection, his hopes and dreams slowly glisten"

To create a sense of rising action and tension, use more intense beats and pacing in the instrumentation and delivery:
- "He started making moves, stacking up that cash flow / But with every deal, he felt his morals slipping low"
- "She chased her dreams, no matter the cost / But the closer she got, the higher the walls"
- "Words turned into fists, fists turned into guns / The brothers were at war, both refusing to run"
- "He got knocked down again, but he refused to quit / Each time he rose up, he spit another hit"

This can be a moment of realization or a dramatic event that changes the course of the story. Use a noticeable change in the music and delivery:
- "He looked in the mirror, what had he become? / His mama's tears, they cut him like a loaded gun"
- "She finally made it, reached the top of the game / But she realized she lost herself, it wasn't worth the fame"
- "The brothers faced off, guns pointed straight / But then they saw their reflection, it was too late"
- "He stood on stage, the crowd cheered his name / And in that moment, he knew he had found his fame"

As the story comes to a close, use calmer instrumentals and delivery to signify the resolution of the conflict:
- "He left the streets behind, found a new purpose in life / And with every verse he wrote, he shared his story and its strife"
- "She found peace within, learned to let go of the pain / And now she uses her voice, to inspire others to gain"
- "The brothers put down their guns, hugged it out through tears / And as they walked away, they left behind their years of fears"
- "He may not be on top, but he's found his own kind of success / And he's grateful for every struggle, 'cause it taught him to never give up and progress"

Finally, end the song with a conclusion or moral of the story:
- "Remember to stay true to yourself, no matter the cost / 'Cause at the end of the day, your soul is all you've got"
- "Fame and fortune may seem like the end goal / But it's nothing if you lose yourself and your soul"
- "Brothers united, stronger than ever before / It's never too late to mend, and heal those broken, raw scars"
- "Through it all, he's learned to find his true voice / And to always follow his heart, 'cause that's his ultimate choice."
