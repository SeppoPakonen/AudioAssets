I know he’s not perfect but there are things that make me happy.
(Something about her sister's wedding)
(his ego gets the best of him and he makes mistakes.)
(The narrator finds out she can't move on from him.)
It's been two years since he left.
And now I walk alone through my city streets at night.

Chorus:
(The narrator feels connected to this person, and the song captures their longing.)
(They spend some time together at the bar, laughing and joking around as they sip their drinks. The narrator finds herself feeling more connected to Steve than she ever thought possible.)

Verse 2 (Steve):
(She remembers his laugh but he doesn't remember her name)
I know I shouldn’t be here
But she’s been waiting for me all these years.
She wants something sweet from him,
In an out so romantic.

Chorus:
(The narrator finds that Steve is trying to help her, while also expressing the pain of their past relationship.)

Verse 3 (Mari):
(Something interesting) The narrator feels something for him now
The song ends with Mari and Steve sitting at a table sipping drinks in an upscale bar downtown.
