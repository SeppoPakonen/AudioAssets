Between authoritarian/libertarian axel, modern pop songs can be considered to lean more towards the authoritarian end of the spectrum. This is because modern pop songs are often produced and marketed by large corporations and record labels, which have a significant amount of control and influence over the content and image of the artists. This can lead to a homogenization of sound and message in pop music, as artists may feel pressure to conform to certain trends and styles in order to be successful.

Additionally, the lyrics and themes of modern pop songs often revolve around commercialism, materialism, and conforming to societal norms and expectations. This emphasis on conformity and consumerism aligns with authoritarian values, which prioritize maintaining social order and control.

On the other hand, there are certainly examples of modern pop songs that promote individualism, freedom, and rebellion against authority. However, these songs are often less popular and may not receive as much mainstream attention and promotion.

Overall, while there may be some variety in the messages and themes of modern pop songs, they generally tend to support and reinforce authoritarian values and ideals.
