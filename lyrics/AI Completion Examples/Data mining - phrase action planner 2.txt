Lyrics:
Im just staring at my empty cans that sprawl across my floor
Im smoking dope in empty cans I got from corner stores
Theres broken glass from broken pieces lying in my sink
Ill wash them down with water getting harder ending blinks
Ill hang with this old feeling, treat it like another friend
Well sit and watch some YouTube videos, were staying in
Well feed a doggo playing looking good with new veneer
Then end the night in covers whisper nothings in my ear
Dont say its personal
Cause Im fine I can do anything
I dont need you
I dont need you
