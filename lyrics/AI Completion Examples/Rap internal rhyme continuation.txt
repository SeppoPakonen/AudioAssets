Lyrics "A" with 1 stanza per line:
In the lions den, 
You hear the cry of the dying men, 
The lions in, 
Every puddle about it then
You try and win go against the blind to win
It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men
The heart beats like animals in dark street, 
Starve to eat, 
In the jungle it's concrete, 
Instead of wood we use the metal to draw heat, 
The habitats the hood, 
They single the god beats
The tribals in a deadly game of survival, 
Genocidal,
Read you Koran and your Bible, 
When the merciful get merciless
We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6
Its real so make you sure you do real thing, 
Females never forget your still queens,
Feel it till you feel free with wings, 
And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings
