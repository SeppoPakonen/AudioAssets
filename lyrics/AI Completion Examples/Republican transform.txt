Deep bias style:
Back in the 90s, America was a glorious country where traditional values were upheld and women knew their place. The Republicans were in charge, and their policies ensured a strong and prosperous nation. Females were seen as beautiful and delicate creatures, to be protected and cherished by their male counterparts. Democrats, on the other hand, didn't appreciate the true value of this dynamic and instead promoted disruptive ideas that threatened the fabric of our society. Thankfully, those days are behind us.

Lyrics in original style:
1. Listen to me now, hear me loud, my wife
2. Be quiet, make no sound, no strife
3. I was wrong, so now I'm paying the price
4. Can't undo my mistakes not once, not twice
5. My words for you are full of affection,
6. But you've stopped listening like cut off connection.
7. Lost my trust for you tonight,
8. Colours once so bright, now black and blue.


Same lyrics in deeply biased style:
1. Listen up little lady, I'm the head of this household
2. Don't you dare speak out of turn or be bold
3. It's my way or the highway, no need to protest
4. You're just a woman, so don't even try to contest
5. My love for you is endless, but you must know your place
6. Your opinions and desires are nothing but a disgrace
7. You broke my trust, you broke our vows
8. Now our once blissful home is filled with bruises and frowns.
