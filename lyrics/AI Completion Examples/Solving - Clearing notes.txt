Notes for lyrics:
Verse 1:
we want alcohol so you know i'm getting closer
brotherhood got to be a joker
she swag you are enough
go somewhere coulda never get enough
and leave her with a dream a different breed
right back to her is momentary bliss
and you may not know gives no indication
and you can laugh a spineless laugh and on for generations

Chorus:
you took me you gon think i invented sex
and that's when you said lately you been obsessed
rollin through them streets and love is all i need
hesitate down with disease

Verse 2:
who that be what is it you want me to tell you
check this out nigga that i'm not afraid to
and they hear me put a shell through you
a time you never can fuck with the dude
the story of us my heartbeats racing
ask him do he need it no matter what were facing
define yourself by it love is forever
and my drive never broken you just did me a favor

Bridge:
stay away from damage she cant run it
we live it now and a hood shit
they say that i'm very wrong and you wont realize
what you have been through unless you talking suicide
you know my weakness break my heart
you might see me now you pull me apart
you know i like the way you move it 
you can find me where i stand never gonna stop this



Notes for lyrics doesn't make much sense alone. Following is improved version of the lyrics with the same end rhymes:
Verse 1: 
We crave for alcohol, I'm feeling closer now 
That bond of brotherhood, we're all clowns 
She's got swag, enough to make me stay 
We'll go somewhere, never getting enough, anyway 
She's got a dream, a unique breed 
But this happiness is only momentary, indeed 
You may not know, but you give no indication 
And your spineless laugh will continue on for generations 

Chorus: 
You take me, making me think I invented sex 
But he says she's been obsessed, what do you expect? 
Rollin' through the streets, love is all I need 
But I hesitate, as I'm down with this disease 

Verse 2: 
Who do I see, and what do you want me to say? 
Listen closely, I'm not afraid to slay 
They hear me and put a bullet through you 
You never mess with someone like me, that's true 
Our story, it's chaotic, my heart races 
But he asks, "Do you need it, despite the tough places?" 
Love defines us, it's forever lasting 
But you gave me the drive to keep on surviving 

Bridge: 
Stay away, don't cause any more damage 
This hood life, that we're living, is savage 
They say that I'm wrong, but you can't realize 
Until you're talking, facing suicide 
You know my weakness, you broke my heart 
You could see me now, you'd pull me apart 
Your movements, I love the way you do it 
You'll find me standing tall, I won't ever quit.

You may not know, she gives no indication
She can laugh a spineless laugh on and on for generations

Chorus:
She took me, she gon think tha i invented sex
That's when she said lately she been obsessed
Rollin through them streets and love is all we need
Hesitate, but still going down with disease

Verse 2:
What is it you want me to tell you
Check this out, babe, that i'm not afraid to
Put it in you, get the night through
This ain't first time you fuck with the dude
The story of us gets my heartbeats racing
Asking her, do she need it, no matter what were facing
Defining life by this, love is forever  
My drive won't break, you just did me a favor  

Bridge:
Stay away, don't cause any more damage 
This hood life, that we're living, is savage 
They say that I'm wrong, but you can't realize 
Until you're talking, facing suicide 
You know my weakness, you   my heart 
You could see me now, you'd pull me apart 
Your movements, I love the way you do it 
You'll find me standing tall, I won't ever quit.
