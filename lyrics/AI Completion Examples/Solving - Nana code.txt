Nana-code is a programming language for rhyming natural language.
The language consists of 9 syllables, which can be connected with '-' character or without.
Syllables have different vowel and consonant rhyming importance.
Syllables:
1. du - importance: consonant 0, vowel 0 (description: rhyming does not matter at all)
2. di - importance: consonant 0, vowel 1
3. da - importance: consonant 0, vowel 2 (description: vowel rhyming has maximum importance)
4. tu - importance: consonant 1, vowel 0
5. ti - importance: consonant 1, vowel 1
6. ta - importance: consonant 1, vowel 2
7. nu - importance: consonant 2, vowel 0 (description: consonant rhyming has maximum importance)
8. ni - importance: consonant 2, vowel 1
9. na - importance: consonant 2, vowel 2 (description: both consonant and vowel rhyming has maximum importance)


Lower than level 3 means a range of possible English syllables.
Extending syllable with one same vowel means a long phonetic pronounciation.
Extended syllables: duu, dii, daa, tuu, tii, taa, nuu, nii, naa
Vowels are usually more meaningful than consonants, so most used nana-syllables are "du, di, da, daa, duu, dii, daa, ti, ta, taa"

Nana-syllables are matched to the phonetic version of the English word, e.g. "wonderful" -> "wʌndərˌfəl" -> "da- da"
