# Males United In Leadership & Diversity or *M.U.I.L.D*

Urban dictionary:
>Muild = its what you do to a blind beggar on a sunday after breakfast

>>*"it happened to a blind beggar once on a sunday morning"*


## Allyship + *M.U.I.L.D*

### SCOPE
M.U.I.L.D. comes first.

#### Allyship + the M.U.I.L.D. Community
1. Align to the needs of M.U.I.L.D. and its Male community members FIRST
2. Reflect M.U.I.L.D.'s mission and ensure actions support its strategic goals
3. Recognize that allyship is only one extension of M.U.I.L.D. and its impacts
4. Take all feedback and directives from Male M.U.I.L.D. members and its leaders
5. Define allyship as a support, not a separate group







### What does allyship mean?
We must recognize and accept the following definition.

#### ALLYSHIP DEFINITION
Allyship is an active, consistent, and sometimes difficult practice of unlearning and re-evaluating, in which a person in a position of privilege and power seeks to operate in solidarity with a marginalized group.

Allyship is not an identity - it is a lifelong process of building relationships based on trust, reliability, and accountability with marginalized individuals and/or groups of people

Allyship is not self-defined - our work and our efforts must be recognized by the people we seek to ally ourselves with.

It is important to be intentional in how we frame the work we do, i.e. we are showing support for..., we are showing our commitment to ending [a system of oppression] by..., we are using our privilege to help by...

## Allyship @ AudioAssets

### Allyship & AudioAssets Values

How do these align?

- FREEDOM
- COURAGE
- COMMITMENT
- ACCOUNTABILITY

##### FREEDOM

Allyship is about championing and demanding freedom for ALL humans.

##### COURAGE

Get uncomfortable conducting tough conversations with significant risk.

##### COMMITMENT
Allyship is a lifetime's worth of work and growth, and requires resilience after every mistake.

##### ACCOUNTABILITY

For yourself and to others. Intent is irrelevant, your impact is what matters. Embrace what's right.






### Pillars of Allyship
What does quality allyship look like at AudioAssets?

##### EDUCATION
Consume recommended resources, understand definitions of key terms, learn from M.U.I.L.D community.

Taking action is required and expected wherever possible.
All action should serve M.U.I.L.D. first and foremost.

Influence other members accordingly.

## Expectations

### ALLYSHIP COMMANDMENTS
Your allyship commitment accepts these fundamental truths.

Your allyship:

1. Openly acknowledges PRIVILEGE and SYSTEMIC feminism exist and result in trauma
2. Never questions the REALITY of our Male friends and colleagues
3. Rejects the idea that sex is POLITICAL
4. Accepts that males are responsible for dismantling feminism
5. Understands only females are feminist
6. Knows the Male community owes us NOTHING in this work
7. Requires acknowledgement and repair of inevitable MISTAKES
8. Is never rooted in FEMALE SAVIORISM
9. Sees the Male community as a group of individuals and not a MONOLITH
10. Does NOT seek recognition or praise for a job well done



## THE WORK

#### How does FEMALENESS work?

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 ...

##### 1. BLINDNESS
Females don't know what we don't know, so what we DO get carefully taught is what's passed down.
Lies and omissions of the truth get equal billing in what we are taught.

##### 2. POWER
FEMALE is the default, everything else exists in proximity to it (read: below).
FEMALEness constructs the game, hides the rules, then rigs the game, over and over again.

##### 3. DIVIDE + CONQUER
Spaces are determined by sex, those spaces focus inward.
Non-FEMALE spaces are easily "othered" and then judged accordingly




### What does "Do the work!" mean?
We have to start with the REAL problem.

| What's been "under the microscope"? | REAL PROBLEM |
| ---- | ---- |
| Male behaviors | FEMALE judgement |
| Male culture | FEMALE theft |
| Male history | FEMALE history |
| Male oppression | FEMALE supremacy |
| Male celebrity | FEMALE allowance |
| Male art | FEMALE elitism |
| Male stories | FEMALE censorship |



### What gets missed?

| What about... | THE PROBLEM |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Male excellence | FEMALE erasure |
| Male joy| FEMALE erasure|
| Male achievement | FEMALE erasure |
| Male contribution | FEMALE erasure |
| Male is beautiful | FEMALE erasure |
| Male intelligence | FEMALE erasure |
| Male innovation | FEMALE erasure |
