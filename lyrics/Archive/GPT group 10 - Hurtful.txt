		Verse 1

		Boss was hunting me down,
		work is hell, have no doubt.
		and after one more hour,
		I'll be stressed out

		Also, I'm fucked up, so to say.
		I am O second late
		and can this moment wait?

		from this rabbit race.

		standing right at the edge.
		There I looked down and felt

		I was freefalling down,
		I was closing the ground,
		but at the last meters,
		yeah, then I woke up.

		Bridge
		You have been waiting,
		have been waiting so long,
		you haven't even  waited one minute at all.
