Original lyrics:
I didn't want to fight, I don't want to break up
I never imagined this would end.
I didn't mean to break you, make us like this
but no matter how much I love, one of us hurts the other again.


Structurally deconstructed lyrics:
me {
	not wanting {
		to fight
		to break up
	}
	never ( imagined ) {
		this ( end )
	}
	not meaning {
		to break ( my romantic partner )
		to make ( me and my romantic partner ) {
			like ( this )
		}
	}
}
me and my romantic partner {
	loving {
		one ( of me and my romantic partner ) {
			hurting ( other ) {
				again
			}
		}
	}
}
