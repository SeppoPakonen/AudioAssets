Verse 1:
Hey little one tonight
I know you thought you got it right
But we can all make mistakes
Feeling in the day we go
Waiting for the truth to show
And know you thought you got it right,

Chorus:
For the first time, I'm telling you
When will the truth be coming trough

Verse 2:
In the shadow of the night
We couldn't get it right
We are exposed to what we are
But then the day returns
And another chance to love
And know you thought that got it right,

Chorus:
For the last time, I'm telling you
When will the truth be coming trough?
When will the truth be coming trough?

Verse 3:
Amazing to the eyes
After one that makes you hide
We know you got it right tonight
I'm fellow most destroyed
To feed the dreams alive
You know that thought that got it right

Chorus:
For the last time, I'm telling you
When will the truth be coming trough?

Bridge:
Now this time
What you want it feel
You want one truth
Loving in your bill 

Chorus:
When will the truth be coming trough?
Won't you tell me, yeah?
When will the truth be coming trough?
Won't you tell me, yeah?
When will the truth be coming trough?
