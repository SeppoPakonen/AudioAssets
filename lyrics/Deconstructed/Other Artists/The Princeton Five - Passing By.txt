Verse 1:
I was only passing by
and then you caught my eye
What a girl
my heart can't last that skirt
Lucky for me that you
can show the engine view
I took one look and knew
You were love
I bet the stars above
like you were passing by

Chorus:
And I never dreamt that I discover
a passer by that'll be my lover
and now on we'll walk together
and that love will seem so grand
as we walk hand in hand
you and I, passing by
passing by

Chorus:
And I never dreamt that I discover
a passer by that'll be my lover
and now on we'll walk together
and that love will seem so grand
as we walk hand in hand
you and I, passing by
passing by
just passing by
