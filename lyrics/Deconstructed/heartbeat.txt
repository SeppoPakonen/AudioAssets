
verse 1
me {
	apologizing you( about my ignorance )
	feeling {
		clarity( about our problems ( not having enough time together ) )
		lack of importance( by anyone )
		longing towards our trekking ( nighttrips ( to see stars ) )
		of holding you tight ( when you were crying )
	}
	promised that {
		I will always ( be next to you )
	}
}
passive {
	time {
		goes faster ( than thinking )
	}
}
us {
	kissing {
		is tied to a moment {
			in which {
				we feel eternity ( without time )
			}
		}
	}
}
passive {
	
}
