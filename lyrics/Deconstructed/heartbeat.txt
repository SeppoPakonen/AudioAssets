Chorus
me {
	not wanting {
		to fight
		to break up
	}
	never ( imagined ) {
		this ( end )
	}
	not meaning {
		to break ( you )
		to make ( us ) {
			like ( this )
		}
	}
}
us {
	loving {
		one ( of us ) {
			hurting ( other ) {
				again
			}
		}
	}
}



Verse 1
me {
	apologizing ( miss ) {
		not calling in ( while )
		felt ( two of us ) {
			too little ( time )
		}
	}
	missing {
		feeling ( like I mattered )
		night trips {
			searching ( sky ) {
				for ( North Star )
			}
		}
		you ( cried ) {
			curl ( up ) {
				in ( my arms )
			}
		}
	}
	promised ( always by your side )
	time ( goes faster ) {
		than ( thinking )
	}
	trips ( tied to moment )
	kisses ( tied to moment )
	feelings ( gone )
	time ( behind )
}
passive {
	two ( lovers )
	sounds ( quieter )
	environment ( dims )
	sky ( darkens )
	until ( last touch )
}
us {
	neither ( tried hard enough )
}
me {
	thank you {
		taking ( time ) {
			ask
			forgive
		}
	}
	maybe ( meet again )
	good luck ( baby )
	wishing ( you ) {
		safe ( journey ) {
			wherever ( you go )
		}
	}
}


Verse 2
me (man) {
	metaphor {
		symbol of love without target ( heart without a name )
		symbol of love sensing something good ( dark spot in the heart brightening up )
	}
	story {
		moved to a new place {
			met a new woman ( possible new wife )
		}
		tried to suppress feelings ( to the woman )
		our eyes met ( I fell in love )
		can't suppress feelings ( as rhethorical question )
		can't fulfill the meaning for this neither
	}
	have been afraid ( the feeling of crush ) {
		because it leads to disappointment
	}
	telling immediately to her ( not waiting ) {
		waiting leads to be closer to death ( waiting until tomorrow )
	}
	does not want to feel the fluctuation of emotions ( alone )
	I don't take any initiative at all {
		if we feel love {
			we drift together automatically
		}
	}
}



Bridge
you {
	were sorry ( you said )
	wanted to forget ( the fights )
}
me {
	remember the fights {
		without showing it
	}
}
you {
	did not show {
		that you cared
	}
	show {
		that you are nice ( unhelpful )
	}
}
