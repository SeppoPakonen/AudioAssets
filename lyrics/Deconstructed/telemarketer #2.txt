Chorus
I'm a magazine seller, so an honest seller and if I want to sell you a magazine: during this call we'll be my best friends, thank you and hello, best regards, your favorite seller.

Verse 1
I'm a newspaper seller, so an honest seller and if I want to sell you a magazine,
so pick up the phone and listen to what I have to offer, through my honest mouth I don't ask for much.
'you bastards are just thieves', Good grandma, you have to earn your money somehow.
The work is easy and the pay is good.
The work will thank its creator if you do it.
Hey listen miss I won't suck you dry: you also get a stylish scarf on top of the deal.
'well, you can tell the next customer that'. Well, hey, this job is not that easy.
Open your wallet and you'll get hundreds of pages.
'fucking cheater', hehe, you won't hit the groin.
Turn off the TV, forget about the PC,
throw away the CDs and buy a couple of magazines.

Chorus

Verse 2
I'll give you a leisurely read, if you have money don't hesitate for a second.
The offer includes Seiska and Donald Duck.
"I'm in prison", you can also order Alibi if it's tough.
For wife Eeva, for only couple bucks, and the bill is divided into three installments so it doesn't start to get annoying.
It was difficult to be a customer, but once I made a lot of deals, I always got the bonuses.
The mood is great and for good reason.
This job gives me money and new friends.
I know your grandmother and your neighbor too.
I share love and magazines, and that's my job.
But sometimes my mouth is lacking in this work and the answer to the offer is beep beep beep.
Still, my future is in this job.
I'll give you some civility, thank you and bye.
