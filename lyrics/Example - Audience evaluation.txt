Lyrics:
I didn't want to fight, I don't want to break up
I never imagined this would end.
I didn't mean to break you, make us like this
but no matter how much I love, one of us hurts the other again.
I like to have kinky bed time.



What a 30 years old woman would think while hearing the song with these lyrics:
-This song really hits close to home. It's so accurate in describing how relationships can become strained even when both people still care for each other deeply. It makes me feel seen in my own experiences and reminds me to be mindful of how my actions can affect someone else. And why does it mention kinky bed time? That's a bit unexpected!
