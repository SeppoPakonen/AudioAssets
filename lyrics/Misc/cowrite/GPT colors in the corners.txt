Song: Colors in the Corners

Verse 1
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say.
You don't read Dekora,
and no other interior decoration media.
With a smile, you say that you don't even know how to do it.
You don't read Dekora,
you still appreciate what is there.

Verse 2
You have your feng shui right, they say.
You appreciate colors,
you build peace, a harmonious atmosphere.
With a smile, you say that you already have everything.
You appreciate colors,
whole life and a little more.

Chorus 1
You can love in many ways and share beauty around you.
Receiving love is then easier,
when you understand many kinds of beauty in life.

Bridge
You whisper your love, it takes its place.
You promise to tell me more tomorrow.
You paint your shady corners first,
you didn't even have time to touch them today.
