Chasing Sunset Dreams
(c) 2024, Seppo Pakonen


Intro:
Sun's shining, wind in our hair,
no more worries, no more cares.

Verse 1:
No more deadlines, no more stress,
just chasing the sunset into the endless abyss.
Leaving behind all the chaos of the city,
we find serenity in simplicity.
In this moment, we are free from the chains of society,
embracing the beauty of nature, it's our own form of piety.
Our worries fade away, as we cruise down the road,
finding beauty in the unknown, in every new episode.

Pre-Chorus 1:
Living life on our own terms,
daring to dream,

Chorus 1:
Living life on the edge, daring to dream,
chasing the sun, realizing what we truly need.
Our hearts on fire, living with pure desire,
daring to break free from the world's cold empire.

Verse 2:
No more missed opportunities or regrets, just
living life to the fullest with no fear or frets.
Leaving behind the drama and the petty fights,
we find peace in the silence, in the starry nights.
Under the starry sky, we leave behind our worries,
finding peace in the silence, dancing like there's no tomorrow.
Wandering with no destination, just following our hearts,
leaving behind the noise and chaos, embracing the arts.

Pre-Chorus 2:
Cause we're living life on our own terms, no one can hold us back
Our hearts are beating as one, we'll leave behind any track.

Chorus 2:
Riding off into the sunset, hand in hand,
feeling the wind in our hair, we're living wild and grand.
Our hearts ablaze, living wild and free,
chasing dreams beyond society's decree.

Bridge:
Stepping into the unknown, hand in hand, we're unafraid,
realizing this adventure was what we truly craved.
Wrapped up in your arms, feeling alive, we'll roam,
leaving behind the noise, finding our own way home.

Outro:
Together we'll ride off to the sunset, leaving behind the noise and regrets, hand in hand we'll face the unknown,
our love will guide us and we'll never be alone.

Instrumental:
Feeling the wind in our hair, we'll sing and sway,
with our hearts on fire, we'll dance like there's no yesterday.
