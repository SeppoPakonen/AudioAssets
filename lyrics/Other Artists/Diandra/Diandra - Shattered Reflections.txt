Shattered Reflections
(c) 2024, Seppo Pakonen


Verse 1:
As I sit alone in this dimly lit room, my heart heavy with hurt and regrets,
I can feel your memories surge, like unrelenting tides that I can't forget.
But as I try to numb the pain with this pen and paper,
the memories just grow stronger instead.

Chorus:
As I look into the mirror, I see a broken reflection of what I used to be,
torn apart by love, a shattered heart that only you can see.

Instrumental:

Verse 2:
As I look into the mirror, the mask of my broken heart starts to fade,
and I see the strength and resilience that I have gained.
But with every tear that falls, I find strength in letting go,
and in these broken pieces, I'll build a new version of my soul.

Chorus:
As I look into the mirror, I see a broken reflection of what I used to be,
torn apart by love, a shattered heart that only you can see.

Bridge:
But as I rise from these ashes, I find my true worth,
and I'll never let anyone dim my light on this earth.
No more playing small, I'll shine brighter than the sun,
my heart may have been shattered, but now I know I've won.

Chorus:
As I look into the mirror, I see a broken reflection of what I used to be,
torn apart by love, a shattered heart that only you can see.

Outro:
As I walk away from you, with tears in my eyes,
I know it's time for me to heal and rise.
