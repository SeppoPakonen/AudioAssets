		Verse 1

		Her love was what you were afraid of.
		You ran away and escaped.
		So why you can't take a girl?
		When she wants you and you like her.
		So stupid, yeah you know,
		but you don't know why you still keep holding on.

		Chorus
		Hey I don't know, I don't know
		one answer to that.
		I'm just a human, not answermachine,
		answermachine.
		Hey I don't know,
		I don't know
		one answer to that.
		Why I'm afraid to let him be with me
		be near to me

		Verse 2
		With men sometimes,
		some hard case,
		will stay unmesmerized.
		Way too handsome that you could
		kiss his lips.
		You missed some chance of your life, because
		too much was look to his eyes.
		Now, he's away and
		you don't know where.
		So why you can't take a girl?
		When she wants you and you like her.

	Description: The lyrics of this song are written in a more narrative style, telling the story of a person who is trying to make a clean break from a situation that has become untenable.

		Verse 1
		I'll do all dirty work once I started it
		Seeing me now, just make you again dreaming
		dreaming about the better times, at somewhere else
		You don't need to tell these thing,
		I see them cleary.
		So cleary they glow upon your eyes.
		After I cheated you.

		Verse 2
		Turning my nose to point directly northwest
		and making some distance surely cheers me up.
		Leaving the house, the car,
		dogs and the bar.
		Maybe I won't ever make you happy.
		Nut sleeping by you, at night
		made me have a meaning.
		I think I will still try.

		Chorus
		I don't need to say,
		there's lack of trust.
		I understand it all,
		no need for language to feel right.
		And too much days have flowed by us.
		One understands or not.
		No need for language to feel right.

		Bridge
		And you should know
		I'll take my stuff and go
		never coming back to home
		tomorrow i'll be gone
