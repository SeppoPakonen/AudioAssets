		Hey girl, I wanna know,
		why you gotta go?

		Summer night and we sit here together.
		Hand in hand, this moment won't last forever.

		But could we still do it?

		Chorus

		It's fire, but easy die, though.
		Can we do the things what mum and dad do?
		Can we still do things what mum and dad do?

		and others don't see you as the same.
		Want to play? Stay calm and start.
