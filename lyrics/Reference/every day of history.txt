Chorus
Every day gives birth to a night
Every love is a work of mourning
Every moment of history
Everyone tells a story

Verse 1
I saw you in front of me, My Rubicon
And a ton in the water to which I silently then I entered with a smile
I fell in love with your story. I read you. I swim in you
And in you then Silently, I was wet with a smile.
I put a mouth on your mouth
In your kissed ear when I whisper
I wished my wish, I made a wish
that was my wish to see us getting into your head
A path of hope from soul to soul, there was no going back.
I cast my lot, It rolled over to you, the years followed each other

Chorus 1
Every day gives birth to a night
Every love is a work of mourning
Every moment of history
Everyone tells a story

Chorus 2
Trip of a lifetime. Its every new.
A fleeting moment for eternity
All of them relate to the story. From happy to sad

Verse 2
And that's how I got noticed, I got the history, Its judgment.
And I join the chain, which is enough for me. 
And I saw it repeating in the chain
Like how cause makes effect, it sows and reaps.

Chorus 1
Every day gives birth to a night
Every love is a work of mourning
Every moment of history
Everyone tells a story

Chorus 2
Trip of a lifetime. Its every new.
A fleeting moment for eternity
All of them relate to the story. From happy to sad

Chorus 1
Every day gives birth to a night
Every love is a work of mourning
Every moment of history
Everyone tells a story

Chorus 2
Trip of a lifetime. Its every new.
A fleeting moment for eternity
All of them relate to the story. From happy to sad

Chorus 1
Every day gives birth to a night
Every love is a work of mourning
Every moment of history
Everyone tells a story
