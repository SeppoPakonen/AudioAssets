Title: Kehuja vai kiitosta?

Verse 1
En halua kuulla mitä luulet että haluan.
En ole niin heikko, että tiedät koko totuutta.
Aina yksin ollaan ensimmäisenä jonossa.
Ei seuraa saa jos tahtoo olla ainutlaatuinen.
Yksinäisyys vastaan keskivertoihminen.
Ehkä vielä joskus toisin valitsen.

Prechorus 1
Nosta kättä, nosta että näen sen.
Näytä että, et oo heikko ihminen.

Chorus
Mikä minä olen antamaan kunniaa?
Kehuja vai kiitosta?
Mikä minä olen antamaan palkkion?
Kehuja vai kiitosta?

Verse 2
Tulin itse vihaiseksi kun sain muilta sääliä.
Mutta nyt kun et suutu, en kai vain sua ymmärrä.
En ole ollut ikinä noin syvällä.
Et kerro miksi tuo ois muita parempi idea.
Eikö äidin poika tohdi muita huijata.
Mieti miksi et oo vielä ensimmäisenä jonossa.

Prechorus 1
Nosta kättä, nosta että näen sen.
Näytä että, et oo heikko ihminen.

Chorus x2
Mikä minä olen antamaan kunniaa?
Kehuja vai kiitosta?
Mikä minä olen antamaan palkkion?
Kehuja vai kiitosta?






English:

Verse 1
I don't want to hear what you think I want.
I am not so weak that you know the whole truth.
We are always the first in line alone.
You can't have a company if you want to be unique.
Loneliness versus the average person.
Maybe someday I'll choose differently.

Prechorus 1
Raise your hand, raise it so I can see it.
Show that you are not a weak person.

Chorus
What am I to give glory?
Praise or praise?
What am I to give a reward?
Praise or praise?

Verse 2
I got angry myself when I got pity from others.
But now that you don't get angry, I guess I just don't understand you.
I've never been that deep.
You don't say why that would be a better idea than others.
Shouldn't a mother's son deceive others?
Think about why you're not the first in line yet.

Prechorus 1
Raise your hand, raise it so I can see it.
Show that you are not a weak person.

Chorus x2
What am I to give glory?
Praise or praise?
What am I to give a reward?
Praise or praise?
