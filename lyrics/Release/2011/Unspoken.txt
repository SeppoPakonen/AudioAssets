Lyrics with long syllable counts:
Verse 1
1 You are nothing like I can handle for a long time
2 I'm still disappointed to understand what you're saying
3 You are not listening me about the things we do
4 There is nothing like that demanding tone of your voice

6 Still you need a traditional but new kind of love
7 You are not at all getting it
8 But I can tell that there's something you honestly want to say

Prechorus 1
9 You still make me believe that you are not sure
10 But I see something in your eyes that won't let me ignore
11 Still you need a brand new kind of trust

13 You are not at all sure about it
14 'Cause you're scared of what it might mean if you do

Chorus 1
15 You are not at all sure about it

Verse 2
19 You are inpatient when I'm trying to understand
20 You won't say it straight that you won't let me in
21 You are skillful at hiding the things that you don't want me to know
22 Other help to cover up the truth you won't show
23 You still make me confused about the secrets that you keep
24 You're not giving me any clues that can make me believe
25 You are not at all getting it
26 But I can tell that there's something you don't want to say

Prechorus 2
27 You still make me believe that you are not sure
28 But I see something in your eyes that won't let me ignore

Song "Something You Don't Want To Say":
Verse 1
I feel it in the air. Something is wrong.
You don't tell me to go on.
You try to pretend you don't feel the same,
Mysteries hiding in  your brain.
I'm trying to get through, but it's so hard.
I can't tell what's on your mind.
It's like the silence is a heavy weight,
And I don't know what I should say.

Prechorus 1
If you're afraid, you can keep it to yourself.
But you gotta know I'm feeling it too, babe.
Lika a secret, something that you can't show,
something you won't let out.

Chorus 1
Oh, what's the thing that I don't know and you know, but you don't want to tell me.
Oh, what's the thing that you don't know how to say and you don't want to show me.

Verse 2
I try to get to you, but you prevent
All of my questions that I sent.
You try to deny and you stay away,
what can I do to get it staight?
So many feelings and so much to say,
But you keep it locked away.
Will we be able to just make it right,
if you don't open up tonight?

Prechorus 2
I know you feel like you wanna but just can't.
You don't have to tell, if you're afraid of that.
Like a puzzle, you are missing a piece,
and you need to find it.

Chorus 1
Oh, what's the thing that I don't know and you know, but you don't want to tell me.
Oh, what's the thing that you don't know how to say and you don't want to show me.

Chorus 2
So many secrets, so many lies, and so much that you don't want to tell me.
So, are you ready to tell me something that you know and I don't, and I could, and you should say.

Bridge
What will be the truth?
What will be the fate?
What's the thing that you're scared of telling me?
Will I ever know?

Chorus 1
Oh, what's the thing that I don't know and you know, but you don't want to tell me.
Oh, what's the thing that you don't know how to say and you don't want to show me.

Chorus 2
So many secrets, so many lies, and so much that you don't want to tell me.
So, are you ready to tell me something that you know and I don't, and I could, and you should say.

Outro
Oh, what's the thing that I don't know?
Oh, what's the thing that you don't show?
Tell me.
