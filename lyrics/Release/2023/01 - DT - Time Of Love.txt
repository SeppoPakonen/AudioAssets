Song: Memories of our love
Author: Seppo Pakonen

Draft 2:
Chorus
(female) Even though we can't last forever
(female) We can keep holding on to time of love
(male) Even though we can't be like the past
(male) we can still keep the love for the moments
(female) I don't know why we fight like this
(female) but I don't want to forget the time of love
(male) I don't understand why you be mad
(male) but I still feel the love for the
(both) memories of our love

Verse 1
(male) Close your eyes and hear my voice
(male) I'm sorry for all the wrong that I've done
(female) I remember when you broke us apart
(female) You took away my life and my heart
(male) I run away without knowing why 
(male) But I never wanted to hurt you with my lies
(female) I don't understand why my feelings changed
(female) You were so ugly and mean to me

Verse 2
(male) I can't trust you anymore
(male) you have made my days so cold
(female) I'm sorry for wanting you back
(female) I was the fool and I know that
(male) Close your eyes and your mouth too
(male) I could break your bones if I wanted to
(female) I admit I had sex with your friends
(female) after that I hugged you again

Bridge
(both) Now my nights are so cold
(both) Now my days are so boring alone
(both) But I am doing fine
(both) There is something wrong with me
(both) Because I'm still in love
(both) Sorry for sounding like I'm crazy
(both) But my love won't just go
(both) Going forward is not easy
(female) I still feel the time of love
(male) We can still keep the memories of the past
(female) I don't want to forget all the love
(both) No matter what we fall apart

Verse 3
(male) I want to kiss you like the our first kiss
(male) but I would rather keep my sanity
(female) I couldn't stand when you had new beer
(female) Now I realize it was good to fear
(male) First you cried and now you want to fuck
(male) Only in your dreams it could be, no luck
(female) You loved me, but I wasn't enough
(female) You cheated me with all kind of stuff

Outro
(both) Time
(both) of
(both) Love
(both) Time of love
(both) Time of love
(both) Time of love
(both) Time of love



Draft 1:

Chorus
female: Nothing lasts forever.
male: Hey girl, we made life out of our feelings.
male: Hey girl, no, even in my dreams I don't miss you.

Verse 1
male: Hey girl, close your eyes and listen to my voice. 
male: My head is hurting because I'm wrong.
female: I remember when you destroyed us on purpose,
female: And ruined my life at the same time.
male: I ran with you without a destination,
male: But I wouldn't be asking you to fuck me or call you a slut.
female: I don't understand why my feelings disappeared,
female: You were so arrogant and ugly to me.

Verse 2
male: I lost my trust with you,
male: You made my world gray.
male: You talked badly about me behind my back and to my face.
female: I'm sorry I wanted you back,
female: I hid that I loved you, it was all my fault, I realized it.
male: Close your eyes and your mouth at the same time,
male: I want to interrupt your thoughts and break your bones at the same time.
female: I admit I had sex with your friends secretly,
female: But in contrast I was hugging you.

Verse 3
male: I want to kiss you with the same feeling as our first kiss,
male: I'm trying to keep my mind in check, but in contrast I look at the old photos, no fun.
female: I couldn't stand when you opened a beer bottle,
female: It was all my fault, I realized it.
male: You cried, but in contrast I'm expected to fuck you now from behind, only in my dreams do you get what you asked for.
female: You loved me but it was not what you wanted from me,
female: In contrast you were cheating on me all over the city.

Bridge
both: The nights are cold without you,
both: The days are boring without you,
both: But I manage just fine without you,
both: Though my heart cries out for you,
both: I'm sorry for exaggerating when I'm angry, my feelings don't disappear, you just changed,
both: There's something wrong with me, because I loved you.
