lyrics:
Verse 1:
Her online followers will share and hit the like button
She is a social queen, a likeable machine
No secrets can be kept, not everything stays perfect
She'll post her pic again, will efforts be in vain?

Chorus:
She comes to my page
She captivates my soul
She comes to my page
and she gets me to follow.

Verse 2:
Provocative statements, creating misconnect
Her little diversion, kills all the assertion
As reels that go viral, clickbaiting is vital
A constant need for more, the internet's a bore

Bridge:
She has been copying content, taking the shortcut
the algorithm won't care
Yeah, she has been posing for us, getting her clothes off
because the payer is the man
