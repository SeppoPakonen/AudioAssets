Title: Rakkauden Aika


Kertosäe:
Vaimo hei, rakkaudesta koti tehtiin
Vaimo hei, ei lämpö pysy ilman liekkii
Vaimo hei, vaikka me tehtiin tän eteen kaikki
Mee, hei hei, pysy pois ikuisesti / nyt (susta) pysyn eros ikuisesti




Title: Time of Love

Verse 1 (by husband):
My wife was feeling my vibe, my mistakes
being supplemented by me feeling depressed
of me and her being together without future plans
asking nicely for her to be out of the house with cash
we were losing love and sex
Me and my wife talking secrets and lies about me and my wife behind me to my face
spending my money, using my cars
My wife asked me to leave the house, close my mouth at the same time while kissing me with the same feeling as our first night
I'm trying to keep control of my life, looking at our old photos together


Chorus:
Hey wife, we made a home out of our love
Hey wife, warmth won't last without a flame
Hey wife, even though we did everything for this
Bye wife, now, I'd rather stay away forever.


Verse 2 (by wife):
I always knew that you destroyed our marriage on purpose, 
you ruined my future and my health at the same time. 
I don't know why you changed, started being distant and cold, 
you became unreasonable, arrogant, and gained so much weight.

I am sorry that I am nasty, 
I was hiding that I still wanted your love back, 
when you were travelling for work I invited your friends over to fuck, and I hugged you when you came back, 
you were't jealous so I took your money for a reward. 

I can't take it anymore when I'm seeing you just being lazy and drinking beer on the couch, 
I guess it's all my fault because I started loving you in the beginning, 
you used to love me, I was what you wanted, but you cheated me all over the city anyway, 
I'm crying out for you to come back.


Verse 3 (by husband):
I guess this argument escalates quickly to other arguments
I'm a family man but my wife is having hot girl summer forever
That's fat my wife daring to provoke and I'm not looking like I lived 100 years already
It's nasty when I'm not getting empathy
My feelings are still the same but my wife stopped appreciating it
I'm distributing my dick on exceptions only and my wife advertise her number like a call girl
I was wrong to love my wife her heart was warm actually cold to me like a ice cube
Maybe I will stay bitter and see my wife as a whore,
stay grumpy drinking beer and smoking because the breakup will be difficult
My wife cried first but now she wants to make love again
The bed is cold without my wife, weekend is boring without her
But still I'm feeling like my future will be just fine without her.
