Chorus:
I didn't wanna fight, wanna be apart
I never saw this coming for us in this way
and I didn't wanna hurt you, wanna do this way
but no matter how much love we got we hurt each other yet again

Verse 1:
I'm sorry, sweetheart, that I haven't called in a while,
Been so busy, been recovering, wasn't feeling so fine


EMINEM

Verse 1:
I'm sorry, sweetheart, that I haven't called in a while,
Been so busy, been recovering, wasn't feeling so fine
Miss you, want to get you here,
Laying in the sand, stars above 

I remember how you were, so warm in my arms,
Promised we would stay together through any harm,
Time passed us by, but our kisses remain,
Kissing you, rocking back and forth again 

As night goes dark, only you I hear,
Under the moonlight, sea is wet around us here,
We both didn't do enough, never could see,
Soon I'm coming back, come to me
Be a little wiser so we could love again

Verse 2:
Feeling like I need somebody else,
Name forgotten, another I felt,
When I came back slamming the door,
A new hope smelling at the floor,
Tried to cover up the feelings, our glances,
Erased all the trouble, but how to extinguish?
Don't know, but to its potency I yield, 
No denying that, don't even try to build
Fear a bit of being attracted, or falling for,
Failing again and not recovering for sure,
Don't want to fall for one who'd leave,
Time is too precious to keep,
Don't divulge to you that you're the only one,
If you want that, you'll feel like my wife anon

Bridge:
Sometime I told you that I'm sorry, wanted wrangles to bury,
But those will stay inside of your heart, even if I don't recognize
I might not have show enough how deeply I care,
Can I be nice again, and what I can repair?




DRAKE

Chorus:
Hate that I had to lead us to this sad place
I never thought for us it'd end this way
Didn't wanna hurt you, didn't wanna make us this way
How we love, sometimes it causes us to pain

Verse 1:
Sorry I ain't been around for a bit
Been kinda busy and still healing from it
I miss you, wanna have you here
Lay on the sand beach when the stars appear
I recall us warm in each other's arms
Swore I'd forever keep us from harm
But time flew by, that kiss still in my mind
Wrapped up in you, just swaying in time
As night came on, your soft voice strung
The moon shone over us drenched with dew
We both must have been doing too little
To keep this thing alive, to see what we could give
In time I'll come back, hoping by then
That we wise up and love again	

Verse 2:
Feels like I need somebody else
Names become a blur with somebody else
When I left last time, doors slamming shut
Saw someone filled with new hope and luck
Tried to mute my craving I just couldn't
Our gazes met and sadness flew
How to dim my passion, man I don't know
But it's taken me where I can't say no
Afraid to fall again, heavy and deep
Time is precious to give each other weeps
Don't wanna lose to someone who won't stay
Never let you know you were my only

Bridge:
Often I mention I'm sorry, wished I could take the fights away
But it lies deep within you, I'm too blind to see
I didn't give enough, so now how do I fix this
Can I ever be nice and get a homecoming kiss


ED SHEERAN

Chorus:
I didn't wanna argue, I wanted to be apart,
I never imagined this ending like this in my heart,
I didn't wanna break you, do this, caused it still hurts,
No matter how much we love each other, we can still hurt.

Verse 1:
Sorry, my love, I haven't been calling lately,
We've had so much to do and I was just recuperating,
I miss you so much, I want you close to my arms,
Lying on the beach, stars all around us like a charm,
I remember when you were so close, in my embrace,
I promised that I'd stay with you in different places,
But time passes by, and our kisses become just a ghost,
Our lips just a memory, feeling long lost,
But still, at night, I hear you near my side,
The moonlight cascading, our bodies wet with sweat inside,
I think we both let out too little,
It's too bad that neither of us saw it in the middle.

Verse 2:
It feels like I need someone else,
Names forgotten, and with others I'm already held,
When last I left, I came with a new hope in the air,
But the feelings, I tried to ignore, seemed to still be there,
How do I extinguish this lust, I don't know,
But it's something I can't resist, that I won't forgo,
I'm a little scared to fall for another again,
And to be let down, I can't bear it, to feel that pain,
I don't want to have to love someone, only for them to leave,
But time is precious, and I wanted it to be for us to share and believe,
No, I won't tell, that you were the one,
But if you'd like, then you can be my wife and my only one.

Bridge:
In between, I said, I'm so sorry, wanting to forget that fight,
But it's still there inside you, though I don't even realize. 
I never showed you enough, how much I truly care, 
Can I be nice again, and start from here?

Bridge:
Välil sanoin et mua kaduttaa, tahdoin riidat unohtaa,
mut ne säilyy ain sun sisällä, vaik mä en huomaiskaan.
Mä näyttänyt en tarpeeksi, kuinka paljon välitin.
Voin mä olla taas nyt mukava, mitä sillä korjaisin.
