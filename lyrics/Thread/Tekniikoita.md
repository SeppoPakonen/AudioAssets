# Storyline techniques

## In general

#### A. Use of a narrative structure
 Many modern pop/rap/EDM songs follow a traditional narrative structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. This structure helps to keep the listener engaged and interested in the story being told.

#### B. Incorporation of personal experiences
 Many modern pop/rap/EDM songs are autobiographical, with the artist sharing personal experiences and emotions through their lyrics. This adds authenticity to the story and allows listeners to connect with the artist on a deeper level.

#### C. Use of vivid imagery and sensory details
 To enhance the storytelling, songwriters often use vivid imagery and sensory details to paint a clear picture in the listener's mind. This can help to create a more immersive experience and make the storyline more impactful.

#### D. Incorporation of dialogue
 Some pop/rap/EDM songs incorporate dialogue between characters to further the storyline. This can add depth and dimension to the storytelling and make it feel more like a conversation.

#### E. Building tension and resolution
 The use of rising and falling energy and tempo in the music can create tension and add drama to the storyline. This can help to keep the listener engaged and build up to a satisfying resolution at the end.

#### F. Use of repetition
 Repetition of key phrases or lyrics can help to reinforce the main message or theme of a song. This can also help to make the storyline more memorable to the listener.

#### G. Utilizing metaphors and symbolism
 Many modern pop/rap/EDM songs use metaphors and symbolism to convey deeper meanings and add layers to the storyline. These can also help to make the story more relatable to a wider audience.

#### H. Surprise twists or unexpected endings
 To keep the listener on their toes, some songs incorporate surprise twists or unexpected endings in the storyline. This can add a sense of intrigue and make the listener want to listen again to uncover new layers of the story.

#### I. Collaboration with other artists
 Sometimes, a collaboration between multiple artists can enhance the storytelling of a song by adding different perspectives and voices. This can add complexity and depth to the storyline and make it more interesting to follow.

#### J. Use of music videos
 In addition to the lyrics and music, music videos can also help to tell the story of a song. The visuals and imagery in the video can add another layer of depth to the storyline and make it more visually engaging for the audience. 

#### K. Connection to current events or social issues
 Some modern pop/rap/EDM songs incorporate social issues or current events into their storylines. This can make the song more relevant and meaningful to listeners and also bring attention to important topics.

#### L. Utilizing catchy hooks
 Catchy hooks or choruses can help to make a song more memorable and add structure to the storyline. This can also make the song more commercially appealing and increase its chances of becoming a hit.

#### M. Experimentation with unconventional song structures
 Some artists choose to experiment with unconventional song structures, such as non-linear storytelling or using unconventional song forms. This can add an element of surprise and creativity to the storyline and make the song stand out in a crowded market.

#### N. Emphasizing emotions and themes
 Ultimately, the most important aspect of a modern pop/rap/EDM song storyline is the emotional connection it creates with the audience. By highlighting strong emotions and universal themes, the story can resonate with listeners and make them feel personally connected to the song.

#### O. Continuity in the album or body of work
 For artists who release a full album or body of work, continuity and cohesion in the storyline throughout can create a more impactful and memorable experience for the audience. This can be achieved through recurring themes, characters, or interludes that connect the songs and tie the storyline together.
 
 
## Instructions

### A. Use of a narrative structure

#### 1. Introduction of main characters and their motivations
First, write verses or lines that introduce the main character(s) and their motivations. This can be done through direct statements or through lyrical storytelling:

- "He was just a kid from the streets, trying to make it out alive / With dreams of fortune and fame, he would take any chance to thrive"
- "She was a fighter, raised in a broken home / With a fire in her soul, she refused to be just another statistic"
- "A tale of two brothers, born in the same hood / But one took a dark path, the other stayed true, it's all good"
- "He had a gift for words, a talent for rhyme / But life never gave him a break, no matter how hard he tried"

#### 2. Conflict introduction and development
Next, introduce the main conflict or problem that the character(s) face and develop it further:

- "But the streets ain't kind, they'll chew you up and spit you out / He needed to survive, so he turned to slinging drugs without a doubt"
- "She wanted to escape the pain, to leave it all behind / But the wounds of her past, they lingered in her mind"
- "One brother sold his soul, the other held on to his dreams / They clashed in a war, fueled by jealousy and greed"
- "He poured his heart out in every verse, hoping someone would listen / But all he got was rejection, his hopes and dreams slowly glisten"

#### 3. Rising action and building tension
To create a sense of rising action and tension, use more intense beats and pacing in the instrumentation and delivery:

- "He started making moves, stacking up that cash flow / But with every deal, he felt his morals slipping low"
- "She chased her dreams, no matter the cost / But the closer she got, the higher the walls"
- "Words turned into fists, fists turned into guns / The brothers were at war, both refusing to run"
- "He got knocked down again, but he refused to quit / Each time he rose up, he spit another hit"

#### 4. Climax or turning point in the story
This can be a moment of realization or a dramatic event that changes the course of the story. Use a noticeable change in the music and delivery:

- "He looked in the mirror, what had he become? / His mama's tears, they cut him like a loaded gun"
- "She finally made it, reached the top of the game / But she realized she lost herself, it wasn't worth the fame"
- "The brothers faced off, guns pointed straight / But then they saw their reflection, it was too late"
- "He stood on stage, the crowd cheered his name / And in that moment, he knew he had found his fame"

#### 5. Falling action and resolution
As the story comes to a close, use calmer instrumentals and delivery to signify the resolution of the conflict:

- "He left the streets behind, found a new purpose in life / And with every verse he wrote, he shared his story and its strife"
- "She found peace within, learned to let go of the pain / And now she uses her voice, to inspire others to gain"
- "The brothers put down their guns, hugged it out through tears / And as they walked away, they left behind their years of fears"
- "He may not be on top, but he's found his own kind of success / And he's grateful for every struggle, 'cause it taught him to never give up and progress"

#### 6. Conclusion or moral of the story
Finally, end the song with a conclusion or moral of the story:

- "Remember to stay true to yourself, no matter the cost / 'Cause at the end of the day, your soul is all you've got"
- "Fame and fortune may seem like the end goal / But it's nothing if you lose yourself and your soul"
- "Brothers united, stronger than ever before / It's never too late to mend, and heal those broken, raw scars"
- "Through it all, he's learned to find his true voice / And to always follow his heart, 'cause that's his ultimate choice." 

#### 7. Use of descriptive language to set the scene
To create a vivid picture in the listener's mind, use descriptive language to set the scene of the story. This can include details about the setting, characters, and emotions in the moment: 

- "On the corner of 5th street, in the pouring rain / He stood tall and proud, never showing his pain "
- "The city lights shone bright, as she walked alone / Her steps heavy with burden, but her spirit still shone"
- "Two sides of the same block, divided by hate / Brother against brother, their bond it did break"
- "In a small cramped room, he sat with pen in hand / His words flowed like music, as he poured out like sand"

#### 8. Utilizing flashbacks or foreshadowing
To add depth to the story, use flashbacks or foreshadowing to hint at events or emotions that occurred before or will happen later in the story:

- "'Cause he's seen it all before, his own father locked in chains / And he vowed to break the cycle, with every step he takes"
- "She saw a glimpse of her future, in a broken, shattered mirror / And she knew she had to break free, from her abuser"
- "They were once thick as thieves, had each other's back / But then they started to drift, and the bond it did crack"
- "He remembered his childhood, when he first found his love for rap / And he knew deep down, he could never go back"

#### 9. Different perspectives or multiple storylines
You can also incorporate different perspectives or storylines in a song. This can be done through featuring multiple characters or using different verses to showcase different perspectives:

- "She tried to hide her pain, behind a smile so bright / But deep inside she struggled, with demons every night"
- "But he saw right through her, and he tried to help / But she pushed him away, 'cause she didn't want to delve"
- "He grew up in the slums, with no food on the table / And he did what he had to, to keep his family stable"
- "But his brother, he took a different path / And he hated him for it, 'cause it caused so much wrath"

#### 10. Use of dialogue or monologue to move the story forward
Dialogue or monologue between characters can add a dynamic element to the storytelling in a rap song. This can be used to reveal their thoughts, feelings, or interactions and further the storyline:

- "She said 'I'll never make it, I ain't worth a dime' / But he replied 'You're worth more, than all the riches combined'"
- "He said 'I'm doin' this for you, I just wanna make you proud' / But his brother snapped back 'You ain't my brother no more, you're just money and clout'"
- "She sobbed 'Why you gotta do this?' and he said 'It's just how it is' / But deep inside he wondered, if this was all worth the biz"
