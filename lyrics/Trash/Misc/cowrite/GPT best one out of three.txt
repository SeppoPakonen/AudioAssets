Song: Best friend

Verse 1
You've been my best friend
always close and caring.
You've been my best friend
gently yielding.

Verse 2
You are a unique friend.
Time with you is like art.
You are a unique friend.
I am full of your thoughts.

Verse 3
You are a unique reliable friend,
weekday oatmeal.
You are a unique reliable friend,
so mysteriously full of emotion

Chorus
We fit well into the same story,
we carry the role of the main character.
"You are the other end of my soul",
I always answer when asked.
Your meaning in my life,
is easy to understand that way.




Song: Colors in the Corners

Verse 1
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they say.
You don't read Dekora,
and no other interior decoration media.
With a smile, you say that you don't even know how to do it.
You don't read Dekora,
you still appreciate what is there.

Verse 2
You have your feng shui right, they say.
You appreciate colors,
you build peace, a harmonious atmosphere.
With a smile, you say that you already have everything.
You appreciate colors,
whole life and a little more.

Chorus 1
You can love in many ways and share beauty around you.
Receiving love is then easier,
when you understand many kinds of beauty in life.

Bridge
You whisper your love, it takes its place.
You promise to tell me more tomorrow.
You paint your shady corners first,
you didn't even have time to touch them today.





Song: Something else

Verse 1
What if I fall in love again with a patient who is under forty.
What would you miss?
Think again!

Verse 2
I enter your stone house.
I can see the bathroom.
I'm looking for something else that love could be.
Think again!

Verse 3
I'll fry these tenderloins with butter for you.
Oh yeah, I forgot you're vegan.
What could love be?
Think again!

Chorus
I am incapable of relationship, love or the lack thereof.
I'm not capable of a relationship. Not to happiness, not to disappointment.
