Intro 
Time heals hearts, but in contrast, too much sweet time can leave beautiful memories.
Things to think about before bed are usually those
that you want to remember in the morning or during the day.
Thinking at night is usually about the memories of love. 

Verse 1
In contrast to being able to bring tears to my eyes,
happy casts a golden shadow in my eyes straight past the beauty of life and straight to eternity.
Days ago I said start happily tomorrow and it will be brighter,
but someone brought out reality with beautiful words like love
that went back into the future and comfort came instead.
An angel raised his hand and turned water into joy and others live with joy in contrast to all who live.
Surprisingly, the truth is wonderful. 
I was told to tour the world and inject love into my heart.
Years pass but I live still with only half of life to make my own love.
Maybe tomorrow I will understand what I feel. 

Chorus 
I am able to run to where love stops and happiness takes me on its wings,
flying to the sky like a singing bird in a cradle that will hold me for a while.
Goodbye my love. 

Verse 2 
I feel one tear falling and another completes my love,
but I ran out of turns before I could play.
I asked my dear friends to be supportive, but understanding always about me.
I remember a couple of moon cycles back and appreciate blue eyes, but they will last forever.
I question if there is enough of the world or too much, love, give, and ways.
Observing the world, it is beautiful when eyes open.
I question why a rose has a fragrance, why love echoes, and why loneliness is answered by love.
Observing Autumn, it is not more beautiful than morning or evening.
