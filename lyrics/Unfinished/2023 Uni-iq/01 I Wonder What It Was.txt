Verse 1
I leave house, I'm having a life
I take different route, because my life is better
The weather is warm and sunny.
I'm going to enjoy.
My friends supports me, and that's great.
My self-made family supports me and I trust them, unlike my relatives.
I chose my people, my family.
Family is not your parents, but people you choose to be with.

Chorus
I wonder what it all was, what my life was all about.
When you have challenges, you can't live your life.
Now I can live my life how I couldn't before.
I'm having a life finally.
