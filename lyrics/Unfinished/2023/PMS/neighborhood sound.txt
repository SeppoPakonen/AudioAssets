Verse 1
I stopped and looked inward, wondering what had happened to my old friends:
Aleksi talking to his romantic partner with a cup of tea,
Maija reading a book while feeling content,
Iiro enjoying a glass of wine everyday life feeling appreciated
and listening to his inner voice for a moment of joy,
Antti at the farmer’s market with a wide selection of fruit,
vegetables, and herbal tea,
Keijo at the doctor’s, friendly, with a box of vitamins
and a camera capturing beautiful views,
and Matti with a good job but in contrast investing in trading platforms to earn more money.
I then addressed the Finnish government, providing solutions under the Northern Lights. 

Chorus
Kaijonharju describing the beauty of nature telling a lot,
Border village buildings made of wood filled with love,
Kaukovainio describing the origin of friendship,
and Toppila describing the prevalence of togetherness with only one option left. 

Verse 2 
I talked, not for myself but for those who can’t,
of many staying up after long hours of work,
the church still there by a park, drinking something sweeter than water when celebrating,
dying nearby the hospital with a fulfilled life, love present between monthly bills, tears streaming past a full wallet, a father being affectionate and a mother hugging the children, and a child smiling with schoolmates on a full stomach. I asked who will take action, real action, against social injustice and documentaries and booklets with enough inspiring stories. I listened to the Finnish government doing well under the Northern Lights.
