Chorus
I, the magazine seller, am happy and speaking the truth to potential customers during this conversation;
we can become good friends.
I am expressing my appreciation and wishing them love,
calling them my romantic partner. 

Verse 1
I am identifying myself as a friendly representative offering them a magazine
and listening to their advice when it comes to the phone.
I'm not asking for much, just some positive words.
The job has some great benefits, such as an enjoyable work with good pay, being a respected creator,
and receiving a beautiful scarf. I'm warning them that this job isn't difficult,
but that their wallet should be open for hundreds of stories, and it won't hurt their spirit.
I'm recommending that they buy magazines, and in contrast to that,
that they should release their doubts, forget their prejudice, and turn off their negative emotions. 

Chorus

Verse 2
I'm offering them the chance to leisurely read,
if they have the courage to not hesitate for a moment.
The products I'm offering include Seiska, Aku Ankka, and Alibi, for happy times.
The payment can be divided into three parts, and in contrast to fear,
they will only be paying for a few moments so it doesn't become dull.
It's easy to be a customer, but once I make a lot of deals, I always get rewarded.
This job is giving me joy, making new relationships, knowing my friend and neighbor,
and sharing joy and magazines.
In contrast to that, if you lack courage in this work, the answer is tut tut tut.
I am offering a great future in this job, with kindness and gratitude.

Sketch
Customer: Is it worth the risk?
Telemarketer: No, it's not like there's a dog buried in the store. What about the deal? It comes with a projector clock that also does laundry and walks the dog. The price is only twenty years worth of stories. Would you like to take a standing order?
Customer: Yes, I'll take a standing order. You're really good at talking and I wish you luck. Thank you!
Telemarketer: Thank you! I wish your family abroad happy times, for example to Spain. Thank you and good evening.
