Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 3: A bridge in the woods
The curtains close and open.

A forest and a weak bridge can be seen on the stage.
A narrator dressed as a jester enters the stage.

Daria wanders through the forest until she spots a bridge.
When Daria is halfway across the bridge, her glasses fall into the river,
which flows bubbling under the bridge.
She frantically tries to find her glasses, but to no avail.
They are already far out of reach.

Daria wanders in the forest for a while, but gives up when darkness falls.
After a while he panics and realizes,
that no one hears her cry in the thicket,
and surely she would never find it again before dark!

Now Daria bursts into tears and sinks to the ground.

DARIA
Oh no.
Why I was so thoughtless?
I will never make it back home safe and sound..
What do I do now?
I knew I was doomed, but in this way…


Daria bursts into tears again!
After a while, a strange noise is heard from the forest.
Daria flinches and listens.

After a while, the voice comes closer.
Now Daria is really worried and decides not to move.

DARIA
Who’s there? (asks scared)
A voice from the darkness answers.

WALTER
Oink, oink.
Uncle Walter here.

DARIA
Sorry, I don't really understand now?

WALTER
Well, Walter, the pig of the pigs, the king of the forests, the sweat of the pens!
Well, babe, don't worry, I'm not going to eat you.
I'm totally vegan these days! (laughs with a piggish laugh)
Well yeah, actually I heard the lady crying and I thought I'd help out a bit, so what?

DARIA
Well, first of all, I lost my glasses,
and I'm not sure if they fell into the river,
and now I don't know how to get back home because I'm half blind without glasses,
and today is an important day, so it would be really nice if…

WALTER
No problems ma'am.
I think I know where the glasses are, if they were the kind of sunken white and big ones like the eyes of some alien.
We were having a party at my place today and, well, it got pretty dirty, after being drunk for 5 days.
So we decided to go for a dip in the river,
and that's where my little cousin found glasses
and I guess he still has them on his head,
so time to hit the road!

DARIA
I don't know if I really trust your words now.

WALTER
Don't worry babe, you can trust me like a rock,
but now move your joints before those glasses are history…
