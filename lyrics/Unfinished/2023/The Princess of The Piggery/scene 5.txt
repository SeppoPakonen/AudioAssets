Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 5: Night in the kingdom's court

Prelude.
The narrator appears again.

NARRATOR
It's morning and Daria wakes up among the pigs.
She’s dirty and smelling of musty,
and she can't imagine what awaits her soon!
Unknowingly, she has entered the realm of darkness, where it is always cold and dark…
Elsewhere in the kingdom of darkness, the greedy king is on the move again,
and he's so cocky that you can't guess what consequences will arise from it...

Scene 1: Office of the Night King

The curtains opens and the image moves to the realm of darkness and heavy music plays in the background.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Have taxes been raised?

SECRETARY
(humbly) Yes.

KING OF THE NIGHT
I guess we haven't paid the grants to the poor?

SECRETARY
Yes your rank, umm…

KING OF THE NIGHT
Did you take booty from beggars for a party?

SECRETARY
Yes course… It was easy but…

KING OF THE NIGHT
No any buts. And have you already bought black suits for the boys at the market for the party and bought them new rings and crowns and looked for companions for the evening?

SECRETARY
Yes I am but…

KING OF THE NIGHT
Look, I don't have time for that kind of bullshit.
I want action now.
Did you understand?

SECRETARY
Yes majesty.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Yea, and tell my queen that now is no time for any extra expense,
because now you have to save money…
Oh yeah, and did you get me that new vehicle?

SECRETARY
I got, your majesty…

KING OF THE NIGHT
Well good.
Bring it out after the party.
Now I have to go to the golf course.
And will you tell the boys that I got them an appointment with the devil's stock exchange for Monday,
that they remember to put their suits on...

SECRETARY
Yes majesty. Umm…

KING OF THE NIGHT
Good, leave me alone now, I have so much to do today…

The secretary leaves and the king stays to play miniature golf.
Behind the door, the secretary has a nervous breakdown
because he was not told that one of her sons is missing,
and she doesn't know where to find the boy before the party.
In a pinch, she comes up with a solution and hopes she doesn't get caught...
The secretary quickly makes a wax doll of the prince with the tailors
and decides to give the king a sedative,
so that he doesn't notice the trick...
After a while, she knocks on the door, sedatives and relaxation drink in hand.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Did you get to give the boys their suits and tell them about the evening's program, and did you remember to ask them to dinner in the castle in half an hour?

SECRETARY
Yes your majesty.
Look, I brought you that relaxation drink of yours.

KING OF THE NIGHT
The king speaks to the secretary.
Please taste the drink first.
I don't drink anything that tastes bad!

SECRETARY
Of course your majesty.
In distress, the secretary drinks the drink and spits it out secretly from the king.
Hmm, that's great.
Now you can taste it too.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Hmm…
It's tasty.
I usually don't like such a tangy taste, but this is fantastic.

The king excitedly gulps down the entire portion.

Location 2: Dining hall

After a while in the castle.
The secretary has had to carry the half-conscious king to the dinner table.
On one side sits the brother and on the other a wax doll representing Simon.
The secretary has to correct the king's speeches, which get worse every moment.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Well, it's great that the boys were able to come.
Thomas seems limp today and Simeon looks half dead.
And where is my queen, secretary?

SECRETARY
She'll be right back, your majesty.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Oh great, then we can talk about tonight's party.
The narrator appears dressed as a jester.

NARRATOR
The secretary realizes that the queen must not notice the wax figure Simeon.
He decides to hide Simeon behind the king's back.
Just when he has Simeon out of sight, the queen appears.
The secretary quickly moves to the queen.

SECRETARY
You look really wonderful and cheerful today.

KING OF THE NIGHT
True, a completely different-looking woman (says the king in a drunken voice)

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Thank you.

SECRETARY
Have you done something to your face and hair, perhaps?

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
I have not done anything.
I've been in a deathly cold bath and washed my hair with cobweb shampoo.
Nothing more special than that.

SECRETARY
But you can see it.
Absolutely amazing finish, and the smell (smells the queen's vomit-smelling hair) is the most wonderful.
But queen, sit on it like that, and I'll bring you a relaxation drink too.
Here, please!

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Thank you.
Hear my love…
I know you're a thrifty person, but what do you think if I bought a whole new outfit for the evening,
and at the same time new jet skis and laptops for the boys.
The queen is already waiting for a negative answer.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Well of course my dear.
Let's get the job done right..

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Oh, but that's nice..

PRINCE THOMAS
Oh, and dad, how about you buy me that new convertible for my birthday.
Thomas is already disappointedly waiting for an answer.

KING OF THE NIGHT
Of course my son.

PRINCE THOMAS
Prince Thomas hugs his father excitedly
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I must go and look at the selection of convertibles!

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Hug the king.
It's wonderful, daddy, that you have finally come to your senses!
The queen and the prince leave the place in awe.

SECRETARY
The secretary takes advantage of this opportunity.
Oh, and I had to get that new vehicle too, didn't I?
King, king?

Suddenly she notices that the king has fallen onto the table.
The secretary tries to come up with a way
to quickly get the king out of sight before the servants.
She takes the wheelbarrow with which he drags the king to his room to rest.

A shadowy figure stands amidst a dark and desolated landscape with a wooden wheelbarrow in tow, transporting the King of the Night in an inebriated state. A full moon can be seen illuminating the bleak sky above.
