Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 7: Getting ready for the date

NARRATOR
Daria returns to the piggery completely delighted by her new acquaintance.
She seems absent and head in the clouds.
The pigs are already organizing parties as usual and the hustle and bustle is on,
when Daria appears on the scene.

WALTER
Look, the girl came.
Wait, Daria has been smoking something.

PIGS
The other pigs start shouting different slang names for the drug in chorus.

SONG 4: EDM rap style song, where being drunk (and on drugs) is idealized.
Pigs have fun on their own.
They tell about their own lives from the point of view of a pig, so to speak, to the rhythm of the song.
Daria interrupts the pigs and says that she is going on a date.
That's what gets the pigs excited and they decide to dress up the princess to look attractive.

WALTER
Listen.
Now let's make the girl look like no one has seen her for centuries, shall we?

PIGS
The other pigs shout "of course" in the background and burp expressively.

WALTER
Hey guys, focus.
Now let's make magic!!
The pigs say their famous spell.

PIGS
Three important words,
that cannot be explained,
they make you live.

They turn the princess into a sexy rocker girl.

PIGS
Looks good.

Pigs whistle after the princess when she goes on a date.
