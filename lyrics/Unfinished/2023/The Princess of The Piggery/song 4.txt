1Play: THE PRINCESS OF THE PIGGERY

SCENE 6: The Clash
Curtains opens and in the background you can see the piggery,
where the princess wakes up to a new morning.

DARIA
Ah, it's a beautiful morning.
I have to go out and see what nature looks like.

For the first time in her life, the princess saw things very clearly,
because he had regained her sight.
And that's not all.

DARIA
Oh how beautiful everything looks, and so clear!

She rubs her eyes a couple of times.

DARIA
I can't believe my eyes.
This is a miracle, I got my sight back!
This nature is so wonderful,
and I have never seen snow in my life, oh how wonderful!

The narrator appears
still dressed as a jester.

NARRATOR
Daria walks for a while in the middle of nature,
until she notices a small cabin in the corner of the forest
and hears someone knocking on the trees.
She decides to approach the cabin out of curiosity.
Just when he is at the edge of the cabin,
she trips on a stone
and flies on her nose to the ground.
The young man who lives in the cabin hears a crash
and appears on the scene!
That young man living in the cabin is not just any young man,
but the prince of the kingdom of darkness,
who has decided to move to the country to prove to his parents,
that no wealth on earth brings so much happiness,
like natural life!
He has intended to prove to his father that he can live in the country completely happily,
without thinking for a moment about riches and fame.
And he's not going to go back to his artificial life where he can't be alone for a moment!

SIMEON
Excuse me.
I don't want to be rude, but what are you doing on my farm and do you have permission to come here?

DARIA
I'm sorry, but I didn't know that nowadays even walking in nature requires a permit of some sort?
I was just in the vicinity and thought I'd come and check out this area too, if you don't mind that too much?

SIMEON
I apologize, good lady, but you have to be careful these days,
when traders of all kinds have been seen in these regions!

DARIA
Right.
Excuse me, may I introduce myself.
I'm… I'm a lady… that's court servant Daria!

SIMEON
I'm Sir Simeon, I mean... Simeon, the prince of the piggery, as Walter claims,
that is, I am a pig herder by my official profession.

SONG 4: Love in the Night

DARIA
Nice to meet you Simeon.

SIMEON
Likewise. Shall I make amends and invite you to my low house for dinner, perhaps?

DARIA
Hmm, apology accepted!

SIMEON
Would it be in half an hour?

DARIA
Why not?

SIMEON
Good.
So the date is arranged!

Lyrics by Tupac, performed by DARIA and SIMEON:
Love in the Night
Verse 1:
DARIA:
I saw your face and I just stopped in my tracks
You had an aura that made me feel relaxed
I knew we had a connection right away
Your smile cut like a knife and lit my day

SIMEON:
I could see it my eyes too,
The fire that's between us grew
The way that night felt so right
It was like a dream that we couldn't fight

Chorus:
DARIA & SIMEON:
We found love in the night
We shined so bright
It came so naturally

DARIA & SIMEON:
(Our love) was so pure and so right
'til the morning light
I'll hold your hand endlessly

Verse 2:
SIMEON:
My heart was yours and I had lost control
I knew I had to surrender my soul
No matter how different life might be
I knew that I wanted you here next to me

DARIA:
So I took your hand, and I never looked back
I know that I can trust in you and never will I lack
We went in circles until we reached the start
I knew that our love was an unbeatable art

SIMEON:
In the back of my head I've been searching for a sign
A spark of fire that can light up the night
I guess it was just two lost souls that met
And changed each other with a single breath

DARIA:
I knew this was different, our love felt so pure
No pain or doubts anymore could obscure
I had found my truth, I knew it was you
Nothing else mattered, I knew what to do

Chorus:
DARIA & SIMEON:
We found love in the night
We shined so bright
It came so naturally

DARIA & SIMEON:
(Our love) was so pure and so right
'til the morning light
I'll hold your hand endlessly

Bridge:
DARIA & SIMEON:
And our souls continue to rise
In a world full of lies
We found a way out of the dark
We have a love like a spark
DARIA:
Let's build a story until the morning light
And keep growing till there's no end in sight
SIMEON:
My love I promise I'll take your side
We'll shine our love until we reach the sky


Chorus:
DARIA & SIMEON:
We found love in the night
We shined so bright
It came so naturally

DARIA & SIMEON:
(Our love) was so pure and so right
'til the morning light
I'll hold your hand endlessly

Outro:
DARIA & SIMEON:
I feel love in the night
We shined so bright
It came so naturally





















Lyrics by Drake:

Verse 1:
Tonight we keep our secret love untold
Nothing could take away our spark of love so bold
A look across the room, our eyes meet in mid-flow
And in that moment we both know

Chorus:
Love in the night, this could be love
Caught up in a dream that we just can't control
Lights start to twinkle, so beautiful we know
It's like love in the night

Verse 2:
A gentle kiss I give to her, and she to me
My life has changed; it's like a fantasy
Beneath the stars, beneath the moon
We dance together, we'll be lovers soon.

Chorus:
Love in the night, this could be love
Caught up in a dream that we just can't control
Lights start to twinkle, so beautiful we know
It's like love in the night

Bridge:
Take me in your arms, we will never be apart
Loving each other through the night until the day we start
We can make it happen, when you and I entwine
Our love will take us through all of time

Chorus:
Love in the night, this could be love
Caught up in a dream that we just can't control
Lights start to twinkle, so beautiful we know
It's like love in the night

Outro:
We will never forget this night, so beautiful it shines like a star in the night
Our love will stay true even if we're apart, love in the night, love in the night.
