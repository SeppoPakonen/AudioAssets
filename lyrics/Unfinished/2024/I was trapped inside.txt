[Verse 1]
They yearn for real conversation
So let go of this false communication

Before the screens divide us apart
Baby, let's hold each other heart to heart

Theres  a life I've been chasing
But on social media it seems I'm always second-placing

And when I post the perfect picture
Then I know it's just temporary pleasure

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you're by my side
I forget the world outside

[Chorus]
Its like a fire was burning and I was trapped inside
Like you extinguished the flames and showed me how to survive

Cause when the world feels like it's crashing down, you're my solid ground
I don't want to ever lose this, cause with you I feel safe and sound

[Verse 2]
I got my closest friends
But not sure who's real in the virtual lens

Dont need to check in everyday
Why bother when we're always okay?

Theres  a conflict Ive been dodging
And I finally faced it right on this stage

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, there's no reservation
No truth, just deceit and manipulation

[Chorus]
Its like a fire was burning and I was trapped inside
Like you extinguished the flames and showed me how to survive

Cause when the world feels like it's crashing down, you're my solid ground
I don't want to ever lose this, cause with you I feel safe and sound

Let the world fall apart, we'll keep on our feet
Bring our contagious joy, to everyone we meet

Cause life can throw us curveballs
So baby, hold on tight and let's make it through it all

[Bridge 1]
Take a risk and dance with me
Watch us glide, let love set us free

Dont be scared, girl, Im here
If danger comes knocking, I'll hold you near

Let our steps be the dance we do,
Bring the doubters in, they'll feel our love too.

[Pre-chorus]
So don't worry, don't you fret about the past
I am here, reliving our journey at last.

Cause when you're by my side
I forget the world outside

[Chorus]
Oh  no, oh no, oh
I'll never forget my true friends, oh

Oh  no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
