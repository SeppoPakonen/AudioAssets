[Verse 1]
The pain in my body is hard to deny
It's a constant struggle just to get by
But my loved ones don't understand
They don't know the pain that I withstand

[Pre-Chorus]
When it flares up in the night
I need to find a ray of light

[Chorus]
I'm gonna find a way
I'm gonna find a way
Cause when the pain's too much, I won't let it stay
I'm gonna find a way

[Verse 2]
This journey of mine, it's been so long
I've tried everything, but nothing seems to belong
and deep down I know
I can't give up, I have to keep moving and grow

[Pre-Chorus]
When nothing seems to work
I have to push through the hurt

[Chorus]
I'm gonna find a way
Yeah, I'm gonna find a way
Cause when the pain's too much, I won't let it hold me down
I'm gonna find a way
Yeah, I'm gonna find a way
Oh, when the pain's too much, I'll fight to stay strong
I'm gonna find a way
Oh, I'm gonna find a way
Yeah, I'm gonna find a way
Cause when the pain's too much, I won't let it win
I'm gonna find a way
Oh, I'm gonna find a way
Yeah, when the pain's too much, I won't give in
Oh, when the pain's too much now
Oh yeah, when the pain's too much now
I'm gonna find a way

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Yeah, I'm gonna find a way
Yeah, now
Oh, I'm gonna find a way, find a way
Yeah, I'm gonna find a way.
