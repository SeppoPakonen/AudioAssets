dreams {
	{
		I had a dream about a blonde girl who looked like Mari, who came into my arms and said let's watch porn together.
	}
	{
		I had a powerful dream.
		In an earlier dream, I was somewhere in a prison death camp.
		Then I got out of there with one other.
		We had come there by dog sledding, and I remember them from an earlier dream.
		The other guy has gone fast to the sled and gone somewhere else with the dogs.
		It has pissed me off, apparently quite rightly so.
		It was somehow related to that death camp thing.
		That leaves me with two dogs and puppies, and a sled.
		They can't move forward because the puppies can't pull.
		Besides that, the other dog gets out of the harness when I shake them, and runs away after the other one that left earlier.
		Then I see when that dog happily reaches the other team, and then the team leader somehow starts to think that maybe I'm not a lost cause.
		Of course, it means that you realize when you have to give up that you let the dogs go if the other option was to kill them in addition to yourself.

	{
		I dreamed about my ex Iina.
		She was really cool and all, but we were still on good terms.
		We came from Helsinki to Oulu by train, and I slept with my head against her legs.
	}
	{
		I dreamed that I saw my ex Iina after a long time.
		And then I just hugged her as long as I could.
	}
	{
		I saw an incomprehensible dream again before waking up.
		I was adventuring on some weird hill, where there were a lot of people, and they were being kicked out.
		There was a bath house on top of the hill, and there were some military people chasing those swimmers out of there.
		There in the spa, the guys sat in the water in those big floating baskets that let a little water in.
		There in the big pool there was an infinite-pool edge, and then everyone else had already been evicted from there, but Paavo VÃ¤yrynen was sitting in a basket near the edge, and refused to give up his basket.
		Then all of a sudden I'm a whale that some submarine is trying to pull out of some dimension gate into their possession, but that whale is able to break away from it, and eventually that whale wins them over.
	}
	{
		I had a dream that I wanted to move to some peaceful but insanely valuable and poorly protected fortress more than anything else.
		It was terrifying.
		Then, on the way there, I met some girls and hugged and said scared that "you don't know where I'm going".
	}
	{
		I had an exciting dream where I was leading some insanely large grassroots orchestra and dance troupe in the backyard of my father's apartment, but which yard was much bigger than it really is.
	}
	{
		Terrible dreams.
		An awful lot in one "dream world" of all kinds.
		I moved somewhere... the first one was near the university (quite different from this one, although something the same), and then I moved or had to move further away.
		(world known from before, different from reality)
		I had already been there in an earlier dream.
		Then I went again.
		It was like that technology village, between the track and the motar, or the other was a river or something.
		It was terribly old and shabby.
		I went there by a different route than before and I was a bit lost.
		I drove through it, and then I found where I usually come from.
		Then I looked for the nearest apartment.
		Then I ended up somewhere at a waterfall at night where someone had taken pictures and all I could see was a computer screen with a before and after comparison.
		On the left was a normal digital image.
		25xx*18xx resolution tjsp reads on it, and on the right side there is someone compiled the same image, where the resolution is 10 times the one on the left.
		The one on the right says "28 gyro rolls".
		I woke up.
