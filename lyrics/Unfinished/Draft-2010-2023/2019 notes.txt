dreams {
	{
		I had a weird dream:
		There were many parts, and I don't remember anything from the beginning, except that we were at our cabin.
		There were a lot of moose hunters in the vicinity.
		I thought I could move our cottage building from there to the center of Oulu, Hietasaari.
		I already started dismantling the boards of the cottage building.
		Then a group came there to help with that.
		Then we realized that it was a pointless job, but that cottage building somehow still moved to Hietasaari.
		Then my cousins Keijo and Päivi came there.
		Ne pointed out that from behind the straw barn you can see directly into the center of Oulu.
		Then the ground began to crumble away from under that straw barn, when it was a little on the slope, and trees were exposed from under it, and they were painted red even though it was against the ground.

	{
		I dreamed that I was with my Eino grandfather driving his Lada and then we had to stop at a barbecue kiosk where we smoked cigarettes with him.

	{
		I had a weird dream again.
		We climbed to the top of a church building with a friend.
		I said something like "before I didn't get used to the height but now I don't get used to this walk" or something like that.
		I saw the top floor with stuff wrapped in newspaper and then next to that was the door we were supposed to go through.
		It led to a side room with glass windows on the walls and ceiling, like in an old-fashioned vegetable garden.
		It was a "summer room".
		It wasn't square, but from the door you went down the stairs inside that room to a living room-like area.
		It had been our goal to get there for a long time, and then we did.

	{
		Näin unta sellaisesta musiikinteko-ohjelmasta.
		Se oli VR ohjelma.
		Siinä oli sellainen pyörivä tsydeemi...
		Biisin edetessä käyttäjä pyöri sellaisen konsolin keskellä.
		Se paineli etukäteen nappeja, jotka vaikutti biisiin.
