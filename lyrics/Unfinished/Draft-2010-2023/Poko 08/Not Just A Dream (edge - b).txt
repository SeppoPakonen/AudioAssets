backstory {
	This sums up my uncomfortable experiences from a year where I'm forced to be around idiot men in military.
	I couldn't find a girlfriend even though everyone else has, and I still feel bad.
}
analysis {
	The notes suggest a deep level of frustration, which could be interpreted as a feeling of being suppressed and judged by society.
	The references to screaming and crying, and wanting to be a weak troll, could indicate a desperate desire for attention or acceptance.
	The imagery of the starry sky and mirror images further point to a need for a sense of identity and belonging, someone or something to look up to and admire.
	This could be interpreted to mean that he seeks external validation and is struggling to reconcile with his true identity.

What makes Poko laugh? {
	Contrasting and Unexpected Elements {
		hundreds of thousands of listens, but the bandmate took the credit and ruined the career
		the people around are idiots, and only supports to give up, even though I already succeeded
		I make an unnecessarily long circuit to find myself in the same place, but the idiots have just quieted down
	}
	Exaggeration and Surreal Situations {
		a non-technical spoiled brat from a rich family supporting the enrichment of the rich is sabotaging me, who is technical, experienced real misery and really found solace in rap
		I feel mistreatment in my heart and I didn't think about race until I was an adult, but now I'm being silenced under the pretext of cultural appropriation
		I was so poor and there were so many rich people that my voice withered from fear. Still, I didn't get external validation that I needed to talk.
		I wanted to be accepted with my own voice, but the spoiled brats from rich families just drowned out my voice with their pretextual complaining and didn't let people focus on the real problem
	}
	Subversion of Expectations {
		People want to dilute me to death and flush me down the drain.
		Even at the handshake, people are thinking about writing history about how they beat me, despite what happened in the fight.
	}
	Absurd concept {
		I want to be a weak troll who screams ugly, because I want to recognize my star from the starry sky
		the mirror image resembles my idol so that if I get into this rhythm, love doesn't remain just a dream
	}
	Playful Interaction with God {
		The bitter lesson is that it's better to be seen as a weak ugly troll than not at all.
	}
	Self-Deprecating Humor {
		I'm worse than a weak troll who screams ugly
		I look at the stars, they're beautiful and bright, but I can't see myself even though I know I'm there.
		I have testicles, but my soul can't use them anymore.
		I'm so ingrained in my bad habits that I don't want a reason from you to do something good.
		I didn't notice it when my longing for love and peace turned from normal to ironic.
		I continue to publicly want peace, love and acceptance, but people around me just say "you can't do that".
		I get into rhythm with my ugly reflection and love is no longer just a dream.
	}
	Irony {
		I'm longing for a way to express my identity and feelings despite understanding that I'm seen as an outsider or "weak troll" by society. 
		The ironic contrast is that although I understand society's expectations, I still hope to be able to find peace, love, and acceptance.
	}
	Playful Wordplay {
		I want to be a weak troll who screams "ugly mirror image resembles my idol!"
		If I get in this rhythm, love won't just remain a dream.
	}
	Absurd and Exaggerated Scenarios {
		A man getting his testicles ripped out of his soul, then crying and hugging someone in public. {
			A man is not allowed to complain until he has lost his manhood.
			The man doesn't understand complaining between the lines and the technique of comedy, so he might rather cut off his testicles in agony.
			A man is not allowed to hug anyone other than his relatives, girlfriends and sports buddies
			If a man were sad to hug a stranger in public, it would not be socially accepted.
		}
		Becoming a weak troll and screaming ugly things at the stars. {
			I don't stand out as a strong man, but then I become an ordinary employee.
			Being mediocre, I blend in with others and can't find myself, even though I used to stand out in a good way.
			My dignity and distinction in a good way was taken away by making me a mediocre man.
			It's difficult to stand out from mediocrity well anymore, but I have the ability to stand out worse than mediocrity.
		}
		Seeing a mirror reflection of an idol in the night sky. {
			A fragmented picture, with many meaningful parts, and none that make up the whole.
			Everything is bigger and more valuable than you, but it is far and completely different.
			You don't see anything familiar and really reminiscent of yourself, but constellations and myths created by people.
		}
		Trying to make love remain only a dream. {
			This happened indirectly when I did not understand the reality.
			The old girls I had to move away from were all about beauty, and after that I assumed all girls were about beauty. {
				Little did I know that things were different in the city.
				I was considered shallow, even though the girls who enjoyed beauty were my closest friends to begin with. {
					I tried to find love for beautiful girls again, but in a new place it meant taking love away, which I realized too late.
				}
			}
		}
	}
	Satirical Observations {
		It is difficult to feel content without the release of anger. {
			The injustice is so far.
			The lack of technique when it comes to comedy is so bad, and there aren't even familiar phrases from dad.
			Here is a man who has defended his country, and the thanks of others are here. {
				They won't let you talk without a big threshold emotional outburst.
			}
		}
		The soul needs more than physical destruction for the intensity of emotion to be felt. {
			Your body is so useless that destroying it would punish your grief, not reward it.
			You have to use your body to feel the emotions until the end.
			You get cheaper when you try to feel things with your body voluntarily.
		}
		Love requires determination and effort for it to become reality. {
			Love doesn't just happen.
			If you work and get paid, and a woman falls in love with your secure income and fatherhood, it happens because of your money chain, which is an illusion for you.
			Any quality of determination and effort won't do: charity and ethical work at your own expense won't do, you have to submit to authority.
			A woman does not fall in love with a strong man, but one who is weak and does not know it. {
				And who blindly does the submissive kind of work and determination robotically by his parents or normalizing school.
				Unfortunately, the woman's understanding of normalizing activity is narrow and cannot understand complex interactivity, but submission and money are in power. {
					It leads to the fact that the man realizes that he has met a woman who seems to be in a dream and understands the consequences of his actions as the opposite of what they really are. {
						Any attempt to wake her up and explain her actions as reversed causes panic and cognitive dissonance.
					}

	Dark Humor {
		{
			I want to be a weak troll who screams ugly, so people will give me a reason to cry and hug a man in public.
			That way, I can feel like my beloved idol and show off my testicles ripped out of my soul to the starry sky.
			That's the only way for me to truly understand what love feels like.
		}
	}
	Casual and Conversational Tone {
		I want to be strong and confident, not weak and vulnerable. {
			I don't want to be mediocre either, because then I won't stand out.
			It would be easy to be weak and vulnerable to stand out, but that also leads to the wrong outcome.
			Determination is essential, but having good reasons and the right techniques are key to gaining strength and self-confidence. {
				Strength and self-confidence are not born with determination alone, but good reasons and the right technique are required for it.
			}
		}
		I want to live a life of ambition and reach for the stars. {
			I don't want my life to just be about maintenance and mediocrity.
			I don't want to always see the good in femininity and their intuitiveness.
			I want to know the truth about how much time I have left and make the most of it. {
				I want to realistically know my fuel, what exactly is left of my life, and I want to maximize its benefit to my own advantage.
			}
		}
		I want to be inspired by the people I look up to and believe that I can make my dreams a reality. {
			Wish there were people who had a better life, but most only think they do. {
				I wish that people who identify with a better life even exist, but almost all of them have only an illusion of it.
			}
			The people I look up to are a rare breed: they're always challenging the narrow-minded values of traditional families and the herd mentality that follows whatever the media says. {
				The people I look up to fit into a smaller and smaller crowd, and they always seem to be fighting against the stereotypical, intact family, small-minded, hidden collectivists running after the media.
			}
			I want proof that the people who inspire me have achieved success through quick and simple steps. {
				I want to see that the people who inspire me have been able to do something easy and fast enough to be successful.
			}
			I'd love to find out what makes the people who inspire me so successful, something that those taking the "easy" route don't know about. {
				I want to see that the people who inspire me have discovered some secret that those living the easy life didn't.
