Story:
 	decided to explore Oulu a bit from street level.
	I saw Iina, my ex-girlfriend, somewhere there.
	Talking and being with her was the same as it was before the breakup in real life.
	It was that kind of weird on/off dating.
	We walked around Oulu with it and ended up kissing.
	We decided to go to a more peaceful place.
	It was already evening.
	Then suddenly we are in the tent.
	In the kind we had there at their cabin.
	Soft, warm, comfortable.
	I talk a lot with Iina.
	One conversation:
	Iina: You were mean to me in the beginning.
	We: Well, you were mean to me at the end.
	Iina was a little different, much sweeter, and smaller.
	It was still really nice just to hang out with her in the tent.
	Then it's time to have sex.
	Iina gets on top of me and starts to position my dick, and presses herself down.
	I'm trying to react in time, but Iina was too quick...
	I said something like "no, I don't have a condom."
	Iina is a little confused.
	The usual birth control pill had taken too much of her reflexes (which she didn't have now).
	I lift her up from my lap to get my dick out and say I have condoms in my backpack, it's over there.
	

A rap love song called "Misunderstood Love Nests" . 
Lyrics: 

Verse 1:
She was my ex long ago
I guess we just outgrew each other and that's how life goes
I was ready to turn the page and move on
But then out of nowhere my feelings were reborn

Chorus 1:
We found a spot for us two
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest
Don't ask it just felt true
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest

Verse 2:
We talked long into the night
Just felt like nothing had changed and feeling alright
It felt surreal, like we'd never broke apart
The shared memories brought on a vivid start

Chorus 2:
We found a spot for us two
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest
Don't ask it just felt true
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest

Bridge:
There was no plan, taken by surprise
Love just found us in this unplanned paradise
The sweetest moment that no one will forget
The two of us in that misunderstood love nest

Chorus 3:
We found a spot for us two
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest
Don't ask it just felt true
Two forbidden love birds in a misunderstood love nest







	
Sexually explicit romantic novel:

Iina and I stared deeply into each other's eyes before I tenderly kissed her lips. I felt the warmth of her body pressing against mine, and I could feel my heart racing. I ran my fingers through her soft hair, and she leaned in closer, feeling the same fiery passion.

We pulled away reluctantly, and I stood up to grab my backpack. "I have something that you need," I said reaching for a condom, and Iina's eyes widened in surprise.

I took her hand and lead her to the tent we had setup earlier. The dim light of a fading sunset filtered through, casting a peaceful hue over the scene. Iina's eyes were intense, and I could feel our mutual desire with every glance.

I gently laid her down on the thin mattress, brushing a strand of hair out of her eyes. I kissed her neck, and she moaned softly, her hands greedy for my touch.

I moved my hands to her waist, caressing her smooth skin. I looked up into her eyes, and when our gazes met, we both knew what had to happen. I reached for the condom, wanting to make sure she was safe.

"Are you sure you want this?" I asked, my voice low and husky. Iina nodded without hesitation.

Without another word, I positioned myself above her, my heart beating wildly. Iina wrapped her legs around me as I sank into her warmth, our bodies intertwined in a glorious dance.

We moved together flawlessly until we both reached our peak. I collapsed onto her, our bodies still joined, and I whispered sweet words of love into her ear.

We lay there together for a few moments, and then I rolled over, my arms wrapped around her as I pulled her close. Our hearts still racing, I leaned in for another kiss before sleep took over.




A sexually explicit rap song called "Misunderstood Love Nests" . 
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She said she wanted to be free, but I wanted her to stay
So I tried to keep her close, I pretended it was okay
But promises of love I made with the wrong intention
Left her in the cold, and buried us in the deep end

[Chorus]
Misunderstood love nests
Built in vain on aching chests
Holes filled with broken promises, deep within forgotten rests
Misunderstood love nests
The bitter strings that never blessed
Riddled in shame, we stand ashamed in our misunderstood love nests

[Verse 2]
We were making plans, but she had one foot out
As I kept pushing back, so what's it all about?
Never really talked about the future, just trying to make it last
But soon our feelings faded, and our hearts encased

[Chorus]
Misunderstood love nests
Built in vain on aching chests
Holes filled with broken promises, deep within forgotten rests
Misunderstood love nests
The bitter strings that never blessed
Riddled in shame, we stand ashamed in our misunderstood love nests

[Bridge]
We chose to ignore the signs, but the damage was done
The lack of security left us too numb
High hopes scattered, shattered by our own ignorance
Knowing we brought it on ourselves, no one to blame

[Chorus]
Misunderstood love nests
Built in vain on aching chests
Holes filled with broken promises, deep within forgotten rests
Misunderstood love nests
The bitter strings that never blessed
Riddled in shame, we stand ashamed in our misunderstood love nests
