dreams {
	{
		I dreamed that I was in the house of Olli-Pekka's childhood home, and then his girlfriend dragged us along to fuck in the closet.
		Then after that, that girlfriend tells me that "come on, take your stuff and leave".
		And I start running and angry Olli chases me, and I end up on a pile of wood, where I hide and he runs by.
	}
	{
		Oh yes, and I had a dream about Maija, and I remembered it on the bus, and now.
		In the dream, he looked at me somewhere and said something.
		I'm starting to think that it also drew a story as sick as Iina's.
		I have lost faith that they stick to reality at all.
	}
	{
		There was a strange moment in my dream, when as soon as I noticed that people were complete fakes, their eyes disappeared and only black eye sockets started to appear.
		In a way, if there wasn't any group left who would have seen the lies or the problems, and they betrayed the trust... or something....
