dreams {
	{
		I dreamed that I lost my job to someone who had more work experience.
	}
	{
		I dreamed that I had money to build my own skyscraper.
		Then, I dreamed that I was in a school-like place, and I tested some take-home ceiling lamp there, which was bright as hell.
		Turning on that lamp set someone's computer on fire.
