Verse 1

Sorry miss, I haven't called in a while.
I felt like the two of us had too little time.
I miss when I felt like I mattered
and night trips, when we searched the sky for the North Star.
I miss the feeling when you cried and curled up in my arms.
Already at the beginning I promised that I will always be by your side.
But time goes faster than thinking.
Those trips and kisses are only tied to the moment.
To the moment when the feelings are gone, when the time is behind.
There is one kiss and two lovers.
The sounds become quieter, the environment dims,
the sky darkens, until the last touch.
Maybe neither tried hard enough,
but thank you for taking the time to ask and forgive.
Maybe we'll meet again. Good luck baby.
Wherever you go, I wish you a safe journey.

Verse 2

There is a question mark in my heart without a name.
It is already a dark spot that has become even dimmer.
After I changed my place of residence again,
I looked into new eyes owned by my future wife.
I did everything I could to make these feelings stop.
Your eyes, my eyes, I think I fell in love.
What could suppress this, nothing.
I searched for an answer in my mind, nothing.
I have long been afraid of the feeling of falling in love;
not the crush itself, but the fact that I will be disappointed again.
I'm telling you this now, not tomorrow,
because every day is closer to death.
And I don't want to let my emotions run wild anymore,
at least not alone without any love around.
I won't tell your name, I won't even whisper it in your ear.
If you feel the same way, you'll notice when we're together.

		-Sorry miss, I haven't called in a while. It's like the time we had together slipped away too quickly and all those moments we shared are now just memories.
		-I remember the trips we took and the way you felt in my arms when you were crying. I promised you that I would always be there for you, but time has gotten away from us.
		-We both tried so hard, but in the end it still caused us both pain. All I have left is to wish you luck and safe travels wherever you go.
		-I didn't want to fight, but no matter how much we may love each other, we can't help hurting one another.
		-My heart holds a question mark without an answer. I wasn't sure if I could ever fall in love again, but here I am. I'm telling you this now before it's too late, but I'm afraid to let my emotions take control.
		-I wish you the best, but no matter how much I care, it won't make up for our parting. All that's left are the memories of our fight, and it's tearing me apart.

		-Sorry I haven't called in a while, I miss when I felt like I mattered
		-I miss the feeling when you cried and curled up in my arms
		-Already promised that I will always be by your side
		-But time goes faster than thinking
		-Those trips and kisses are only tied to the moment
		-To the moment when the feelings are gone, when the time is behind
		-I searched for an answer in my mind, nothing
		-I have long been afraid of the feeling of falling in love; not the crush itself, but the fact that I will be disappointed again 
		-I won't tell your name, I won't even whisper it in your ear 
		-Sometimes you said you were sorry, you wanted to forget our fight 
		-You didn't show enough how much you cared 
		-But no matter how much I love, one of us hurts the other again.
