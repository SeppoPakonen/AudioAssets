Suomenkielinen rap-kappale:
Säe 1
Astuimme markkinatorille ja katsomaan
Selvästikin jotain on pielessä täällä
Mistä olivat kaikki vanhat kaverit ajalta
Timo makaa penkillä pullon vierellä
Miina ottaa pillerin ja hikoilen runsaasti
Iiro ottaa siimaansa ja humaltuu arkeen
Eksyy pois ja eksyttää syynsä
Hän ostaa apteekista outoja desinfiointiainevoideita ja halpoja lääkkeenruiskuja
Kätkee taskuihin 12-paketin oluita
Hänet havaitaan turvakameran toimesta ja saa nukkua vankilassa
Ja hän seuraa, kuinka palkka hupenee pelikoneiden kiekoille
ja vaatii Suomen valtiota toimiin

Kertosäe
Köyhän kortteli
tiili-asuntoja joissa on pelottavaa sisällä
Alkoholin juominen on jonkun ammatti
Ei voi saada työtä, joten rikos on ainoa vaihtoehto

Säe 2
Naapurit eivät edes käänny toisiaan apuun pyytämään
En voi enää edes auttaa itseäni
Täällä ei enää käydä edes kirkossa
Monet rukoilevat pullon ääressä kun yö tulee
Rakkaus ei tule halvalla tässä ympäristössä
Itkut ovat liian kalliita itkemiseen
Isä iskee äitiä ja loppuu tämän olemassaoloon
Lapsi seuraa isänsä esimerkkiä eletyllä vihaella
Suhde lapsen ja hänen luokkatoveriensa kanssa heikentyy
En jää henkisesti häkkiini köyhyyteen ja syrjäytymiseen
He alkavat vaatia sosiaalista muutosta ja toivovat valtion kuuntelevan


Kertosäe
Köyhän kortteli
tiili-asuntoja joissa on pelottavaa sisällä
Alkoholin juominen on jonkun ammatti
Ei voi saada työtä, joten rikos on ainoa vaihtoehto





##################################### 

Verse 1
We step into the market square and take a look.
It's obvious something is wrong here
Where are all the old friends from that time
Timo is lying on a bench with a bottle beside him
Miina takes a pill while profusely sweating
Ilkka takes a sip of liquor in the middle of everyday life
He gets lost and misplaces his reason
He buys a strange selection of denatured alcohol and cheap medicine syringes at the pharmacy
He steals and shoves a 12-pack of beer under his coat
He gets caught by a security camera and has to sleep in a jail cell
And he watches his paycheck disappear in the gaming machines
And he calls on the Finnish government to take action


Chorus
neighborhood of poverty
concrete houses with fear inside
alcoholism is a job for someone
you can't get a job, so crime is the only option

Verse 2
Neighbours don't even turn to each other to help out.
I can't even help myself anymore
People here don't even go to church anymore
Many pray to a bottle of booze when night comes
Love doesn't come cheap in these parts
Tears are too expensive to cry
A father hits his mother and ends her existence.
Her child will follow his example with hatred inside.
A child encumbered worsens his relationship with his schoolmates.
I won't stand still for my poverty and marginalization.
They start an initiative and hope the government listens
We stand alone in this battle for a social change

Title: Neighborhood sound

Lyrics:

Chorus
Kaijonharju, Rajakylä, Kaukovainio, Toppila x2

Verse 1
Stop for a moment, look around.
What happened to your old friends?
Arttu is lying on the bench with a bottle by his side.
Milja takes the next pill while sweating.
Ilkka takes a splash of liquor in the middle of everyday life.
He (Ilkka) silences his own reason at the moment of his whim.
Arska's pharmacy has a clear selection;
cider, beer and windshield washer fluid.
The police don't care, thinks Kalle,
and shoves the 12-pack of beer under his coat.
But the camera is in the corner of the shop,
Kalle sleeps his nights in the cell again.
After all, Make has a good job,
but the pay-hungry gaming machines eat it up.
Listen, O Finnish government,
we are not doing well here under the North Star.

Chorus x2
Kaijonharju, poverty tells a lot
Rajakylä, concrete houses full of fear
Kaukovainio, the cradle of alcoholism
Toppila, crime is the only option

Verse 2
I don't talk to get something myself,
but for those who are unable to do so.
Because many stay up late after work,
for many, the church has been replaced by a liquor store.
Many drink stronger drink than water when mourning,
and they die with a broken liver in a nearby hospital.
Love doesn't come home between bills.
Tears roll past the empty pockets.
The father beats the mother, who spanks her child.
A child hits his schoolmates on an empty stomach.
I just ask who takes the initiative:
A real sanction against marginalization.
Documentaries and booklets are not enough,
they are light entertainment and that's about it.
Listen, O Finnish government,
we are not doing well here under the North Star.
