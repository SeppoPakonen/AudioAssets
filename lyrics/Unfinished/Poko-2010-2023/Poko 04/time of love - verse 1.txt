Lyrics:

Verse 1 (sung by the man)
Close your eyes, listen to my voice;
my head hurts because I was wrong again.
I ran with you without a destination,
please, would you you get out of my head, bitch?
I'd like to ask for it with flowers, but if you remember, I wasn't the one who started the breakup.
I just lost my trust with you,
Sweetheart, you made my world gray.
You talked bad about me behind my back and to my face,
you smoked my cigarettes and drank my beers.
Close your eyes and your mouth at the same time,
I would like to interrupt your thoughts and at the same time your mouth.
And at the same time, I'd like to kiss you,
with the same feeling as our first kiss.
Damn, I'm trying to keep my mind in check, but it's no fun
when I look at old photos.
