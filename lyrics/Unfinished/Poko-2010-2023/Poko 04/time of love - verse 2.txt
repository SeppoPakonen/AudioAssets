Verse 2 (sung by the wife)
I always remember when you destroyed our relationship on purpose,
you ruined my life and me at the same time.
I just don't understand how my feelings really disappeared,
you're fucking arrogant even though you're just an ugly fag.
Uh, sorry, but I wanted you back.
I hid it from you that I loved you.
When you weren't at home, I used to have sex with frendies,
I did it secretly, I didn't tell you but I hugged you,
later as a reward to myself, I stole your money,
I just couldn't stand it when you opened the beer bottle again.
It was all my fault, I guess you already realized that,
you loved me and I was what you wanted.
Still, you fool cheated me all over the city.
After all this, my heart is crying out for you.
