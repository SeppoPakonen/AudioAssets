Title: Time of love

Lyrics:



Verse 3 (sung by the man)
Try to understand, this argument will lead nowhere,
my heart is hot, but you have no spark.
Oh, I'm ugly, oh, you didn't dare to provoke,
after all, I don't look like I came from a meat grinder.
Okay sorry, I was exaggerating when I got angry,
but my feelings don't disappear, you changed.
And I distributed mine dick only inside this city, where
you kept your legs wide open all for the whole country.
There was something wrong with me too: I was wrong to love you
Now my heart warms to you like a freezer.
Maybe I'm bitter, maybe I see you as two,
with a glass of liquor in hand, because the breakup was bitter.
First you cried, now I should fuck you from behind,
it only happens in dreams, because you get what you order, and didn't order it.
The nights are cold without you, the days are boring without you,
I still feel like I can manage just fine without you.
