			I started making music with my laptop PC
			I used Cubase software for making music
			I hadn't been making music alone in 2 years, so I was clumsy
			I never had made music for myself, which was a new idea
			However, I still didn't have my voice, because it had always been very weak side of my due to traumas
			I couldn't sing or rap over mental barriers
			I wrote lyrics and notes

		about songs {
			overall {
				I didn't have any good way out to publish these songs
				I didn't have friends in music industry (at least any who wanted to help me)
				I didn't get any meaningful support from anyone
			}
			"edge - b" {
				this is very touching song, which I made from a piano song, that I had been played for years
			}
			"hometown" {
				this is the song I first watched a video tutorial for. the tutorial taught how to make a "french house" style
				I was very pleased with this piece
			}
			"loathing inc" {
				with this song I let out some steam that was in my head after the band days and after leaving the band
				I combined the band's electric guitars and dance music
				the tune was also particularly twisted and haunting, which described my mood well at that moment
			}
			"slow dancing" {
				in the army I had met a lot of old friends who reminded me of slow dancing in limu discos.
				I wanted to bring out my sensitivity, and the feeling that comes from being in a dark space and waiting to dance with a woman
				this also represents the feeling of seeing incredible beauty and being noticed by that beauty
			}
			"crash landing" {
				this was originally a remix of a well-known song.
				i used the "french house" techniques learned for this technique.
				I was really happy with this song too and listened to it on repeat
			}
			"energizer" {
				this is an interesting composition and i don't remember much about it
				I didn't finish this song very far in the beginning
				this represents a chord progression that my army buddy played and made humorous lyrics for other army buddies
			}
			"rabbit's life" {
				this song represents my only success, the Finnish rap song "Syd√§men Asialla"
				it has much of the same sensibility and emotional state
				the purpose is to tell about relationships and love in a romantic way
			}
			"sailing" {
				this song brought joy, which was in short supply in these times
				I didn't think about it at the time, but this song kept my thinking independent and supported my joy as an independent artist
			}
			"sexy" {
				it goes without saying that I missed a girlfriend and sex terribly
				this song gave me some good feeling that I will still find a beautiful girlfriend
			}
			"blow my whistle" {
				this song was a modernized version of one of the Finnish folk songs
				my old friends had reminded me of elementary school in Kiiming, when we used to sing that folk song with the class
			}
		}
		notes {
			{
				my canoe can cross this sea
				but I missed home already a week ago
				I am free and fly like a bird
				if you don't consider this damn water under me

				my meal is delicious
				after all, I drank three beers
				what's up, you've changed
				everything is fine in here
			}
			{
				Call and Sing I can hear your voice
				the song of the birds and the grasshoppers
				chord triad and last measure
				played my guitar and broke the amp

				where were you when we last saw each other
				what is written in the stars
				my tongue went into a knot when I corked the beer
				and this is not embarrassing in light of the future
				to clarify, my world is in your words

				morning coffee is delicious at sunrise
				the most demanding work maybe before lunch
				I don't want pain on my deathbed
			}
			{
				problem solving needs a problem
				the situation should become certain
				change requires work
				are there any tools?
				The problem is: What tools do we need?
				Enough power, technology and practicality
				Wrong tool, the biggest problem.
				The tools are attractive to use.
				Sometimes a wooden plank is more useful as a chopping board than as firewood.
				Sometimes a diamond is more profitable in a drill bit than as a status symbol and "crow decoy".
			}
			{
				It's for the video blog
				It's in the voice
				power and technology
				practicality arises when writing a manuscript
				is in the picture
				technology and practicality
				but no power
				the motive for producing is found in the joy of doing
				but there is no motive for publishing, which affects the content of the manuscript, i.e. the practicality of the end result
				the image can be made more effective by cutting and using simple effects
				however, the biggest efficiency effect comes from the host, who should dress correctly
				which clothes would you choose yourself?
				if you were the furthest away from "yourself" when you were naked, what clothes would you wear then?
			}
			{
				I've been listening to a lot of music about fire.
				Well, I decided that once all the songs are on fire, I won't make one either.
				I made the words and thought about the title for the song. At first I was going to name this song "light my cigarette, babe", but then I came to my senses, and I realized that the whole point of this thing is that the title must have the word came, so the name of the song then became:
				"Light my cigarette (on fire), babe"
				(pours Zippo gasoline on himself)
				(lights a match)
				Light my cigarette, babe
				I broke my zippo and I'm wet from gas
				i need your fire, baby
				but be careful, girl, I might flare up
				why are you staring at me babe
				so now you dig that match
				you have a crazy glint in your eyes
				if the flame touches the gasoline
				babe, I might freak out
				You can't do that
				The girls want to burn me at the stake, I want to smoke a cigarette and not die
				I messed up the words again in the wee hours, I can only touch the cancer wrap with my lips
				I'm something but not crazy and not a king
				this is about when I went home through the grill
				Had to run away, babe
				pyromaniacs are scary, I'll die wet from gasoline
				I can't get a cigarette, babe
				must have, someone will give
				Would you give me fire?
				Would you give me ... fire?
				French fries, hamburger and coke
				and you don't have that snuff to sell? Oh no, you can't help it
			}
			{
				God: Host, hear me.
				Who's talking what?
				God: It's me, God.
				Wait, oh God.
				God: I came to tell you that you are one of my best jokes.
				Okay... thanks.
				God: Show me those scars.
				Er, what scars?
				God: I said, show me those scars!
				*pim* red visible scars appear on the forehead.
				what the f? why did you do that oh it's just masking tape.
				I was hit in the head with a bottle and got a lightning bolt scar.
				in the same way as, I won't even say who.
			}
			{
				I have a problem
				in which I can't get out of my head
				that one song where everything was told

				When the ice falls and the sky tears apart
				when the world is over
				you still can't take my soul away
				even if you were true

				you sink into the lake and your mind wanders
				the moisture burns my skin
				does the world shut down when i close my eyes
				or is it just me
			}
			{
				In the beginning you walk towards your destination. You're walking somewhere at sunset direction.
				Route is blocked by mountains and gorges. You will pass the mountains, because it would be quite foolish to climb up and come back down. Especially when the destination is waiting.
				Sometimes you encounter a ravine, and you must get the other side.
				You descend the ravine slopes, and you look at the other side looking for a route there.
				Sooner or later, you step wrong and you hit the bottom of the gorge.
				Fall does not hurt, because the walls are soft as pillows. And from the bottom you will find all the things you've always dreamed of.
				Even if you're trying to get away and climb up the slope, you will fall down.
				Eventually you will no longer try to escape, and you accept things as they are.
				<3
			}
			{
				Don't give me anything, I want your anger
				I already have my testicles ripped out of my soul
				don't give me a reason to cry and hug a man in public
				I want to be a weak troll who screams ugly

				I recognize mine from the starry sky
				the mirror image resembles my idol
				if you get into this rhythm
				love doesn't remain just a dream
			}
			{
				social media fills my time
				although I don't like those messages either
				and that's not really my boyfriend

				that also just reminds me of how I embarrassed myself back then
				and it's not my boyfriend, it's annoying on purpose

				there are about two hundred of them
				they will listen, maybe, when I open up again
				don't put an invite in the farm game, I don't want to
				wasting my time more on this, which I'm doing even now
				so I'm waiting for new status updates.

				Social media calls to you like a siren's song
				there is strength in the crowd, they say, and each of them wants to take me with them
				relationships start and end, everything is visible, I know where you live.
				and I'm not really your boyfriend, I'm still talking shit behind your back

				there are about two hundred of them
				they will listen, maybe, when I open up again
				don't put an invitation, in the farm game, I don't want to
				wasting my time more on this, which I'm doing even now
				status updates are pouring in
				family, friends and others listen to my words
				is this pointless and that's why it's so interesting
			}
			{
				There are people who imagine themselves to be livestock. They believe that the police use their supercomputers to keep an eye on every person, they believe in encrypted technology for teleportation, for governments to communicate with extraterrestrial life.
				There are also people who move this world to card and board games, and improve the world one card at a time.
