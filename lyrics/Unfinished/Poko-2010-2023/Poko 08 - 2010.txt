			I used Cubase software for making music
			I hadn't been making music alone in 2 years, so I was clumsy
			I never had made music for myself, which was a new idea
			However, I still didn't have my voice, because it had always been very weak side of my due to traumas
			I couldn't sing or rap over mental barriers

		about songs {
			overall {
				I didn't have any good way out to publish these songs
				I didn't have friends in music industry (at least any who wanted to help me)
				I didn't get any meaningful support from anyone
			}
			"edge - b" {
				this is very touching song, which I made from a piano song, that I had been played for years
			}
			"hometown" {
				this is the song I first watched a video tutorial for. the tutorial taught how to make a "french house" style
				I was very pleased with this piece
			}
			"loathing inc" {
				with this song I let out some steam that was in my head after the band days and after leaving the band
				I combined the band's electric guitars and dance music
				the tune was also particularly twisted and haunting, which described my mood well at that moment
			}
			"slow dancing" {
				in the army I had met a lot of old friends who reminded me of slow dancing in limu discos.
				I wanted to bring out my sensitivity, and the feeling that comes from being in a dark space and waiting to dance with a woman
				this also represents the feeling of seeing incredible beauty and being noticed by that beauty
			}
			"crash landing" {
				this was originally a remix of a well-known song.
				i used the "french house" techniques learned for this technique.
				I was really happy with this song too and listened to it on repeat
			}
			"energizer" {
				this is an interesting composition and i don't remember much about it
				I didn't finish this song very far in the beginning
				this represents a chord progression that my army buddy played and made humorous lyrics for other army buddies
			}
			"rabbit's life" {
				this song represents my only success, the Finnish rap song "Syd√§men Asialla"
				it has much of the same sensibility and emotional state
				the purpose is to tell about relationships and love in a romantic way
			}
			"sailing" {
				this song brought joy, which was in short supply in these times
				I didn't think about it at the time, but this song kept my thinking independent and supported my joy as an independent artist
			}
			"sexy" {
				it goes without saying that I missed a girlfriend and sex terribly
				this song gave me some good feeling that I will still find a beautiful girlfriend
			}
			"blow my whistle" {
				this song was a modernized version of one of the Finnish folk songs
				my old friends had reminded me of elementary school in Kiiming, when we used to sing that folk song with the class
