original {
	I have a problem
	in which I can't get out of my head
	that one song where everything was told

	When the ice falls and the sky tears apart
	when the world is over
	you still can't take my soul away
	even if you were true

	you sink into the lake and your mind wanders
	the moisture burns my skin
	does the world shut down when i close my eyes
	or is it just me
}
backstory {
	For a year, I had been thinking about surreal lyrics for one of my surreal compositions, which told about the end of the world, which starts from a single lake.
}
analysis {
	The notes may reveal a desire to retreat from the world in order to protect the self from external disruption.
	The lake may represent a flight into the unconscious, while the "ice falling" and "sky tearing apart" may indicate a fear of or a resistance to intrusive external forces.
	The "moisture burning my skin" may express a sense of psychological trauma stemming from a violation of boundaries.
	The phrase "does the world shut down when I close my eyes, or is it just me" reflects a feeling of isolation and disconnection from society.
}
theme {
	The notes appear to suggest feelings of distress, vulnerability, fear of external forces, and a longing for a safe refuge away from the world.
	These themes indicate a deep yearning to protect the self at all costs, even from the end of the world.

What makes Poko laugh? {
	Contrasting and Unexpected Elements {
		Falling ice vs the warmth of the lake {
			This song seems to be about a difficult situation that has an emotional weight to it.
			The struggle between the heaviness of the falling ice from the sky and the warmth of the lake seems to be used as a metaphor for a choice between two sides of a situation.
			The person in the song is trying to figure out the right thing to do, and is feeling overwhelmed and confused.
			The phrase “when the world is over, you still can’t take my soul away” could suggest that, no matter how bad things seem, the person has a strong sense of identity and inner peace.
			The idea of “closing their eyes” at the end of the song could signify that the person in the song is going to take a break from the confusion and try to find a peaceful place within themselves before facing the choice again.
		}
		Sky tearing apart vs the world shutting down {
			The sky tearing apart could symbolize the feelings of despair and hopelessness that one might feel when faced with a problem they cannot solve.
			The world shutting down could symbolize the feelings of depression and isolation one might feel when overwhelmed by their own thoughts and emotions.
			It could also serve as a reminder that the only way to overcome such feelings is to literally shut down the outside world and take some much needed time for yourself. 
		}
		Taking away the soul vs closing of the eyes {
			The song could represent the difficulty of letting go of a person or situation.
			With the ice falling and the sky tearing apart, it symbolizes the intense emotion of grief and pain.
			The idea of "taking the soul away" could represent a sense of being unable to let go and keep being attached to something in spite of all the destruction happening to it.
			On the other hand, "closing of the eyes" could represent facing reality and finally accepting that one cannot be attached and that they need to move on.
			Therefore, the song could be a metaphor for the pain of letting go.
		}
		World being over vs being true {
			The speaker appears to be in a state of existential questioning, struggling to make sense of a world in which they see both beauty and destruction. 
			The notion of the "world being over" could represent a feeling of hopelessness, of being overwhelmed by forces outside of one's control. 
			The phrase "being true" could be a reflection of the speaker's desire to remain authentic and true to their identity and values, even when faced with the prospect of a rapidly changing world. It could also mean wanting to stay true to a particular sentiment, to not give up the fight even when times are tough. 
			The imagery used in the lyrics also suggests an emotional shift from confusion and fear to determination.
			Despite feeling fearful, the speaker is determined to hold on to their identity even if the world seems to be crumbling around them.
		}
		Buyer's remorse vs wander of the mind {
			This song is about the feeling of being stuck in a situation, with seemingly no way out.
			The person is overwhelmed by feelings of regret, which is symbolized by the line, “When the ice falls and the sky tears apart”.
			There is an emphasis on trying to escape from this reality, as the person searches for relief within their own mind.
			Accompanied by a sensation of panic, they fear the world may close in on them, “Does the world shut down when I close my eyes or is it just me?”
			Despite the adversity they face, the person still hopes that their soul will never be taken away, a sign of hope that they can overcome their current predicament.
		}
	}
	Exaggeration and Surreal Situations {
		When the ice falls and the sky tears apart {
			The lyrics of this song suggest intense feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
			The vivid imagery of the ice falling and the sky tearing apart implies the end of the world, which can symbolize the end of something cherished or a difficult time in life.
			There is a strong sense of resignation and despair in this piece, evoked by the feeling of helplessness and lack of control over the situation that is being experienced.
			The statement "you still can't take my soul away" could suggest that the individual is finding some comfort and strength in themselves and their spirit, despite the terrible circumstances they are facing.
			Additionally, the idea of sinking into the lake and the "moisture burning" the singer's skin suggests intense emotion and a deep sense of vulnerability.
			Finally, the hollow riddle posed at the end of the song ("Does the world shut down when I close my eyes, or is it just me?") reflects a sense of loneliness and alienation from the rest of the world.
		}
		You can't take my soul away {
			This song most likely reflects a feeling of loneliness and isolation experienced by the singer.
			They are struggling with the idea that they are forever alone and no one can truly understand them.
			The image of the lake and the sky tearing apart further emphasizes this notion of being powerless and vulnerable.
			The line “you still can't take my soul away” implies that while the singer may feel powerless, they still have some semblance of control and autonomy.
			The phrase “the moisture burns my skin” could be interpreted as feeling weak and helpless in the face of whatever forces are coming their way.
			The last line “or is it just me” reinforces the feeling that they are the only one in the situation.
		}
		You sink into the lake and your mind wanders {
			This line could be suggesting the feeling of being overwhelmed by thoughts.
			It may be indicative of anxiety, and the idea of falling into a neverending cycle of worrying.
			The imagery of water usually represents a feeling of being lost or overwhelmed, so this verse could be speaking to those feelings. 
			
			Additionally, the idea of “mind wandering” could represent the feeling of being out of control of one’s own thoughts.
			This could also suggest a form of dissociation, where the speaker is out of touch with reality due to the overwhelming nature of the thought process.
			This can be an indication of depression, where the person feels as though they are losing control of their own mind.
		}
		The moisture burns my skin {
			This seems to symbolize the idea of someone feeling overwhelmed and burned out by the difficulties of the world and their own personal problems.
			The experience of feeling overwhelmed and "burned out" emotionally and mentally can be intense and overwhelming.
			The line, "the moisture burns my skin" could possibly refer to the physical symptoms of stress and too much emotional weight, which can include feeling like one is about to burst into tears or feeling physically weighted down.
			It could also allude to the sensation of dread that comes with having too much to worry about.
		}
		Does the world shut down when I close my eyes? {
			The speaker might be feeling overwhelmed or possibly anxious, questioning whether their perception of the world is indeed reality or only a part of their imagination. 
			The image of the "ice falling and sky tearing apart" could be symbolic of the chaos that the speaker is feeling, and how it could be out of their control.
			The speaker's words could be interpreted as a plea for help and guidance from a higher power, in order to make sense of their current mental state. 
			The rhetorical question "Does the world shut down when I close my eyes?" suggests the speaker is questioning life itself, not just the reality of the current moment or situation.
		}

			Ultimately the song points to the power of inner strength and resilience even in the face of the most difficult of circumstances.
