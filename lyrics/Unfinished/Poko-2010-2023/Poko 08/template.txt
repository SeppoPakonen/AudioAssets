		Steps to take to make this "Mockery Humor":
		1. Start by identifying an exaggeration of a predicament that many people can relate to.
		2. Add a humorous slogan or statement to make light of the situation.
		3. Embrace the laughter and show a smile to show that you don't take yourself too seriously.
		4. Add a twist at the end to keep the joke fresh.
