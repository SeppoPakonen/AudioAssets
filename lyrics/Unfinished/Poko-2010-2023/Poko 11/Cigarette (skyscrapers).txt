Story:
	There were girls a year younger than us at the table next to me, and then I chatted with my dance partner.
	She was called Laura.
	Well, a really beautiful and good-looking girl, I would date her anytime.
	Then it asks if I'm going for a cigarette, and in a sexy way, looking in the eyes.
	I look at the clock and I'm almost late for school.

Sexually explicit romantic novel:

As soon as I stepped in the door I saw her. She was breathtaking - her long, honey-blond hair cascading down her smooth, toned back, her porcelain skin glowing under the soft neon lighting. I was instantly drawn towards her like a magnet.

My dance partner, Laura, smiled shyly, her blue eyes twinkling in the darkness. I felt my heart skipping as she asked if I wanted to go outside for a cigarette, her lips close to mine. I knew I should have gone home, but I was captivated by her beauty and charm.

Without saying a word we walked out of the club, taking in the fresh night air. We locked eyes and it felt like eternity. I moved closer, desperate to feel her lips against mine. I slowly caressed her face, and before I knew it we were lost in a passionate embrace. I never wanted it to end, but we both knew that our time was running out.


A sexually explicit rap song called "Cigarette":

Verse 1:

I come through the club, step in the door
That's when I spy her, she's smokin' hot
Her long honey-blond hair and that sweet sexy body so fine
My heart starts racin, our eyes meet and the connection's divine

Chorus:

It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
One look and I'm hooked, it's on me
It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
It's her and me tonight, wanna step outside?

Verse 2:

She asked if we should go and take a break
I was hopin' she would so my heart it ached
That fresh night air, the silence so sweet
My hands around her waist felt like silk on my skin, that's the heat

Chorus:

It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
One look and I'm hooked, it's on me
It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
It's her and me tonight, wanna step outside?

Bridge:

We start to kiss beneath the stars so bright
Our bodies pressed together, the fire ignites
My heart's pounding and my head's spinning round
It's like a rollercoaster there's no way to slow it down

Chorus:

It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
One look and I'm hooked, it's on me
It's that Cigarette, that Cigarette
It's her and me tonight, wanna step outside?
