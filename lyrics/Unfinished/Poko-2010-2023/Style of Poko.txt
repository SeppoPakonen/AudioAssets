humour {
	Poko has a twisted sense of humor that combines elements of irony, absurdity, and wordplay.
	The speaker employs dark humor and unconventional scenarios to create a comedic effect.
	
	Let's delve into the various aspects that contribute to the humor {
		
		1. Contrasting and Unexpected Elements {
			The humor arises from unexpected or contradictory elements in the text.
			For example, the speaker initially decides not to create a song when all the songs are on fire, but then proceeds to create a song with the title "Light my cigarette (on fire), babe."
			This play on words adds a twist to the expected phrase, creating a humorous and unexpected juxtaposition.
		}
		2. Exaggeration and Surreal Situations {
			The speaker's actions and statements are exaggerated and surreal, contributing to the humor.
			Pouring gasoline on oneself and lighting a match, while simultaneously requesting someone to light their cigarette, creates an absurd and outlandish scenario that defies logic.
			This exaggerated imagery and actions evoke a sense of playful absurdity.
		}
		3. Subversion of Expectations {
			The humor stems from subverting conventional expectations or norms.
			The speaker's playful warning that they might flare up if the flame touches the gasoline or their comment about being stared at by girls who want to burn them at the stake creates a contrast between the expected reactions and the unexpected outcomes.
			This subversion of expectations adds an element of surprise and comedic effect.
		}
		4. Dark and Irreverent Comedy {
			The humor also draws on dark and irreverent elements.
			References to wet from gasoline, pyromaniacs, and a desire to smoke a cigarette while not dying contribute to a twisted sense of humor.
			The juxtaposition of potentially dangerous or morbid situations with casual and humorous language adds an edginess to the comedic tone.
		}
		5. Playful Wordplay {
			The lines contain playful wordplay, such as the use of the phrase "cancer wrap" to refer to a cigarette and the question about clothing choices when feeling furthest away from "yourself" and naked.
			These linguistic twists and turns create a humorous effect by playing with language and subverting linguistic expectations.
		}
