		Verse 1
		When you let me be all alone
		When you are hour away from home
		Then I become sad, it makes my heart start playing a blue beat
		I call to you to come soon, if not i'll be angry to weeks
		Am I always your only one?
		In hour you could cheat at least once.

		Verse 2
		When you are all day with your friends
		when you are drinking night with them
		Then I get mad 'cos how you can have fun somewhere else than here
		I call to you yelling that I hope that you drown to your beer
		Am I just your own unpaid maid?
		No, I'm unsatisfied house-wife

		Chorus
		Be, always be so close and near
		so I can move my hand on your neck
		and you can hold your head on my shoulder
		baby be.

		I miss you, I need you, come, make me full
		(my shoulder needs your head)
		you're too long, too long shopping
		(my shoulder needs you yet)

		A word about Finnish rap and internet teens;
		there's no attitude,
		even if there was something to rap about.
		But no, your topics are childish.
		There is no ear for tune,
		you sample and make a beat.
		You think you're criminals when you fight
		at a sausage stand and tune up a moped.
