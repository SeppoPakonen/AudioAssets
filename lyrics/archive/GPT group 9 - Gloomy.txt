		Verse 1
		My hands are shaking, my mouth is dry
		what is this? Am i gonna die?
		I used to got it every day
		now it's hard to find.
		They say that I'm becoming just like them,
		but I'm not bad, get it yet.
		They say I'm in half-way to hell.
		That's not true
		They say devil takes me,
		one vain by vain.
		That's not cool.

		Verse 2
		Autumn comes, I'm searching one.
		Walk in forest gave me none.
		Got to pay that "five on it".
