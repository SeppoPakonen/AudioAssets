    Gentle Glides

    Verse 1
    We'll glide so slow and so sweet
    Our bodies intertwined in heat
    We'll move together in perfect harmony
    Your touch so gentle, it's so divine
    My heart still singing, can't deny
    The pleasure that comes with your gentle glides

    Chorus
    Gentle glides, oh, I feel so alive
    Gentle glides, our passion on the rise
    Gentle glides, so tender, so sublime
    Gentle glides, a pleasure divine

    Verse 2
    Your fingers softly glide o'er my skin
    Can't help but tremble in your embrace
    Your touch, so gentle and inviting
    As we move together in perfect grace
    Your lips, so soft and so inviting
    As we move together, so divine

    Chorus
    Gentle glides, oh, I feel so alive
    Gentle glides, our passion on the rise
    Gentle glides, so tender, so sublime
    Gentle glides, a pleasure divine

    Bridge
    So gently, sweetly, our love will grow
    Our souls entwined, like a rose in the snow
    Our love will blossom, and never die
    As we move
