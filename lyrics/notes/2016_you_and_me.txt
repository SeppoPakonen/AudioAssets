    Verse 1
    Far away from my arms,
    I can't hold you near,
    Longing for the day when you will be here. 
    My heart still beats for you,
    It's so hard to be apart,
    But I will never forget our love at the start. 

    Chorus 
    Loving you from afar,
    My love will never die,
    Even if the miles keep us apart,
    I still see you in my heart. 

    Verse 2
    Through the night I still dream,
    Dreams of us being one,
    Dreams of being together, under the sun. 
    My heart still aches for you, 
    And my soul still sings your song,
    But I will never forget just how strong our love was for so long. 

    Chorus 
    Loving you from afar,
    My love will never die,
    Even if the miles keep us apart,
    I still see you in my heart. 

    Bridge 
    Though we may be apart,
    Our love will never cease, 
    And I will always have you in my heart,
    No matter how far away you are from me. 

    Chorus
