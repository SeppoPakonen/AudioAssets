Verse 1
He is so shy,
he'll never say
the words his heart wanted to say.
He's been alone in this cafe
so many days.

Chorus A
In this small cafe, he'll never be brave,
he'll never show what's hidden away
in this small cafe.
I'm waiting for him
to break the chains and
find a way to see what's in his heart.

Verse 2
The waitress smiles, but he can't see
How much she wants to be with him.
He's too scared to say what he wants to say
so he just stay.

Chorus A
In this small cafe, he'll never be brave,
he'll never show what's hidden away
in this small cafe.
I'm waiting for him
to break the chains and
find a way to see what's in his heart.

Chorus B
Come in, come in,
I'm here for you.
What you need?
Come in, come in.
I'm here for you, please,
let me see what's in your heart.

Bridge
He takes a deep breath and looks around
He knows it's time to make a sound
He stands up tall and speaks out loud
His heart is a song to be found.

Chorus A
In this small cafe, he'll never be brave,
he'll never show what's hidden away
in this small cafe.
I'm waiting for him
to break the chains and
find a way to see what's in his heart.

Chorus B
Come in, come in,
I'm here for you.
What you need?
Come in, come in.
I'm here for you, please,
let me see what's in your heart.
