Poem "casually":
With every sight, with every glance that you have made to me,
You have blaized hate, what nobody ain't explaining.
I cannot speak, I cannot laugh, I cannot be like me.
'cos if I do it, I bet it is just suffering.
No, sun won't so long time nomore shine
days get dark and sun just ain't so bright
when snow comes ground then will be white
and that is just alright.
O'm gettin cold, so do you do.
I want get back to warm but I can't move
Can I be here near to you?
I think it's just alright
Why won't you now calm down
Can I be near to you? I'm trembling and I feel cold too,
Hey you can keep hating, but I won't make a sound or two.
Will warmness ever come here true?
Can sitting here bring closer us?

lets go from cold to warm
Jesus has mercy
lets go from the cold to the god
The tubers will grow into a big field if they can grow.
God is the face of the sun.
Life is passable if you only talk about God.
I guess it can find power in itself.
You can get wisdom, stories and philosophy from the church.
Always remember to share wisdom.
Life is a squirrel's wheel, Jesus is there to eat,
the congregation blesses from there.
Jesus saves the little children with the help of the priest
unblessed saved no.

on and off, won't stay on,
even if you put it on again.
Have a nice trip.

Let's go opposite,
and not looking back.
I want to be a train
on the tracks, for which another
face is deadly.
Have a nice trip.

Bridge
I dare not walk, but there is a taxi,
you messed up my self-esteem.
Cliché, yes, but I want to go to you.
I break down more and eventually die.
A year and a half, half is too much.
The boy brings other women.
Only a dead end connects us,
it's like this now or it used to be different.




Poem "Spikeless rose:
A thornless rose.
It's perfect, without malice.
It doesn't hurt, even if I treat you badly.
As beautiful as it is rare.
The man is mean, stupid as a potato.
It's getting harder every day.
He treats his wife badly.
A woman can't hurt her back, even if she wants to.
I'm found in the trash in bad shape.
Still, I can radiate, without any bad thoughts
I don't want to give up, I have to turn my head.
But when a rose is given to someone, they get to keep it.

In life sometimes,
some hard things,
will stay undone forever.

You ran away and escaped.
So why you can't take a girl?
When she wants you and you like her.
So stupid, yeah you know,
but you don't know why you still keep holding on.

Chorus
Hey I don't know, I don't know
one answer to that.
I'm just a human, not answermachine,
answermachine.
Hey I don't know,
I don't know
one answer to that.
Why I'm afraid to let him be with me
be near to me

Verse 2
With men sometimes,
some hard case,
will stay unmesmerized.
Way too handsome that you could
kiss his lips.
You missed some chance of your life, because
too much was look to his eyes.
Now, he's away and
you don't know where.
So why you can't take a girl?
When she wants you and you like her.
So stupid, yeah you know,
but you don't know why you
still keep holding on.

Outro
I already closed my eyes, but then I ran away
Never tasted you kiss because I was scared




Song "She went away":
Chorus
I didn't want to fight
I don't want to divorce
I never imagined this would end.

but no matter how much I love
one of us hurts the other again.

Verse
Sometimes you said you were sorry,
you wanted to forget our fight.

how much you cared.
You can be nice again now,
but what would you fix with it?

Verse 1
I was walkin in snow,
walking like black widow,
With no feelings to a thing,
but with mean face with grin.
Boss was hunting me down,
work is hell, have no doubt.
and after one more hour,
I'll be stressed out

Chorus
Also, I'm fucked up, so to say.
I am O second late
and can this moment wait?
Or can I really get away
from this rabbit race.
This precision is what I hate,
like expression on your face.
All it remains for me is to escape this rabbit race

Verse 2
I was one restless soul,
standing right at the edge.
There I looked down and felt
undone work on my neck, then
I was freefalling down,
I was closing the ground,
but at the last meters,
yeah, then I woke up.

Bridge
You have been waiting,
have been waiting so long,
you haven't even  waited one minute at all.
Do I give this document now or do you fire me off.
I have this feeling,
but I ain't gonna brake our laws.
I feel like killing you,
killing them all.




Song "Feeling blind":
Again you're talking shit,
behind his back.
You shout so loud that he hears.
You don't care, you filthy bitch.
You keep having fun at his cost.

You're feeling blind
You always whine
You are cool girl
with a retarted mind.
Go to hell
We don't care about you




Song "Heart cone":
Verse
At night you take me to sleep again,
To the clouds or just up to the tree,
I'm a squirrel, I'm yours
you are my heart cone.
But sometimes at night
I can't sleep.
It's crazy when
i can't touch you

Chorus
The hours are empty, this year reminds me.
I have a woman in mind, but she drowns in booze again.
Even this life is difficult without a woman,
thus the distance gets its new victim again.




Poem "Alone in the dark":

Verse 1
After summer we saw him first time
he looked like making suicide
he told how everyone will hate him
told how his pet-rat died
fell to ground and pretened crying
asked from god why his girlfriend died
we had been heard: this girl is from canada, and they
talked in chat, but she blocked him there

Verse 2
After a year what he said was so true
all they hated him but for reason
he always whined, but never listened
he was violent and played a ninja
But, came a day when he wanted to change
wanna have friends and be happy
One of the girls who was there at the first day
shaked her head and made clear to him, that

Verse 3
After few years it really felt yet
when cutting wrists, wasn't anymore fun
it's so hard to be boy friendly
when noone neverever speak to him
he came to school and pulled off his gun
killed himself front of everyone

words can be heard in the air, they say:

We know you act
We know you lie
Wwe know that your girlfriend
haven't ever died
somewhere in the north canada

Never come back to home,

Losing your heart

Song "Doing the dirty work":

Verse 1
I'll do all dirty work once I started it
Seeing me now, just make you again dreaming
dreaming about the better times, at somewhere else
You don't need to tell these thing,
I see them cleary.
So cleary they glow upon your eyes.
After I cheated you.

Verse 2
Turning my nose to point directly northwest
and making some distance surely cheers me up.
Leaving the house, the car,
dogs and the bar.
Maybe I won't ever make you happy.
Nut sleeping by you, at night
made me have a meaning.
I think I will still try.

Chorus
I don't need to say,
there's lack of trust.
I understand it all,
no need for language to feel right.
And too much days have flowed by us.
One understands or not.
No need for language to feel right.

Bridge
And you should know
I'll take my stuff and go
never coming back to home
tomorrow i'll be gone




Song "black and white":
Verse 1
A pure angel girl with a black devil.
A nice boy and a naughty girl.
It's the same as doing homework again, says the boy in the evening, while the girl is smoking next to him in the playground.
Someone is playing a new song again, not energetic but a relaxed melody.
The girl is carefree and she and her friends try drugs.
The boy wants to continue in peace, just the same course as always before.
The girl parties and is looking for the right one, she gets disappointments from parties.

Verse 2
Both have their reasons when they meet at night.
They understand each other, one wants the other's life.
When a girl wants to feel safe and a boy wants something exciting.
They are similar, but completely different.
The girl describes herself as kind and tells beautiful stories about her school days.
A nice boy tells about his bad adventures, without the nice parts.
The girl thinks things are not bad, when she herself is much worse.
In the boy's opinion, the boy is not doing well at work at school, he himself is much better.

Chorus
When one knows the other at first sight, the other tells about himself, as if about the other's life.
Black and white, both opposites have mind and life.
Together they are much more than gray.

Wanna wake up, with you, tomorrow




Song "Mr. Loser":
Verse 1
See under flower's leaf, that green should feel relaxing.

No-one never try to get hurt you.
This, feels like the home that you lost before you came here, lost before died.

Sun, bugs, flies, all your friends they, wanna get to know you.
Wind that blows in the air, it says hello to you too.
Here no-one says never bad about you.

Welcome, this will be your destiny.
Welcome home.
Welcome, stay here whole eternity.
Welcome home.




Song "Let's leave":
Verse 1
If you don't find a girl at spring, you'll be alone the summer.
I found mine at may.
One can leave the work and friends behind.
We just thing our private place.
We can live in a moment and do a job we get.

Verse 2
Be always next to me.
Don't leave me alone.
If I won't see you every day,
I think I'll abandoned.
Others may say that I'm too attached to you.
They'll remind me that I don't own you.
But we can still live in the moment like teenagers.

Chorus
Let's go
These people won't understand us
Let's leave this place
Let's go
We can live in a moment
Let's leave them




Poem "Calling the man to death":
Do you hear the death of a song - it sings to you
as a visitor in the shadows it sings to me
it sings us its immortal tune
to some as a bullet to others as a snake's head
You can die tomorrow or today,
so remember each of your friends
In the midst of snakes, I ask you to understand
good and bad are inside, hear that voice
because you rarely hear it and that's a shame
You never know when the messages will arrive calling the man to death
For a moment you can hide, wrap yourself in a black veil




Poem "Nightmare":
I hope that it was just a bad nightmare.
I hope that you will still exist somewhere.
Did O lose you?
Was it true?
I cannot say.
Scary faces in my dreams.
Devil faces far as I can see.
Not one is yours.
I think it's great,
but I could use a guide in dark.
With dark feelings, you just went away.
I was sorry, 'cos this ain't our day.
You left me thinking, without good reasons.
Without waiting, comes the bad nightmare again.
It tells me, that you will not even care.
I won't believe it.
Go eat shit, my partner stays with me.
I feel and see those things I was afraid.
I hear those things, what I hate
I do those things, with them like a bedmate.
I was in the sea as a small fishbait.




Poem "A sexy enemy":
Our sexy enemies, they don't see us.
I don't have any money, I'll just watch.
The price of free meat per kilo is too much for me.
At the bar, the women need a drink and I pay, but they don't stay to chat with me.
Girls are looking for handsome men, money and power,
Their x-ray vision looks at the crotch, looking for men with big penises.
My love songs haven't worked, not the nightly calls, not the shared laughs.
If the hottest new thing is to be stylish, then I prefer to belong to the ugly people.




Song "Computer guy":

Verse 1
Last week I had a big problem with a computer
it didn't connect to gallery at all.
Then I found this friendly guy who wanted to help
I felt love at our very first sight.
Looked it and laughed that he hasn't used windows much
boasted that he use more linux than that
still he only had to click it once and it worked
it made me, oh yeah, very impressed

Verse 2
Games what you play makes me horny and want you much
programming skills of you I can't resist
Everybody thinks like that and they all wanna
say like I can say that "mine he is"
In our history is starting new period
muscular men ain't wanted anymore
handsome guys can also forget girls,
when comes day, quite soon when nerds win them all

Chorus
You are my computer guy
with geniousness in your eyes
Microbit flow goes through your soul
and your computer mind
Glasses fits fine in your style
Hotter can't be other guy
Microbit flow goes through your soul
and your computer mind




A sarcastic song "A shoulder to lean on" for female singer:
Verse 1
When you let me be all alone
When you are hour away from home
Then I become sad, it makes my heart start playing a blue beat
I call to you to come soon, if not i'll be angry to weeks
Am I always your only one?
In hour you could cheat at least once.

Verse 2
When you are all day with your friends
when you are drinking night with them
Then I get mad 'cos how you can have fun somewhere else than here
I call to you yelling that I hope that you drown to your beer
Am I just your own unpaid maid?
No, I'm unsatisfied house-wife

Chorus
Be, always be so close and near
so I can move my hand on your neck
and you can hold your head on my shoulder
baby be.

Bridge
I miss you, I need you, come, make me full
(my shoulder needs your head)
you're too long, too long shopping
(my shoulder needs you yet)

Poem "Teen in Custody":
Teen is ill but parents don't care, they just want to their summer house.
One of seven days she can be with friends otherwise in summer house.

Selfish egocentric dad don't care that child can't be with friends.
Young age and drinking with friends, she is just too damn happy.
When came home dad didn't thought so and remaining week is custody.
Everyone will test their wings and that wasn't even dangerous.
Selfish egocentric dad wants child to watch there children-shows.
I had many those unlucky friends, who must be with parents, because they don't trust that

My girlfriend had done many things, had caught with drinks, had caught by weed,
and now she can't be all by herself and must be that teen, that teen of this poem.





A short text "Finnish rap":
A word about Finnish rap and internet teens;
there's no attitude,
even if there was something to rap about.
But no, your topics are childish.
There is no ear for tune,
you sample and make a beat.
You think you're criminals when you fight
at a sausage stand and tune up a moped.




A comedic song "Invincible" for bandmates and for a female singer:

Verse 1

Cutting wrists is regular teen decission.
It's maybe good, it decrease your blood pressure,
but no-one tells you about the mess.

Verse 2
Summer night and we sit here together.
Hand in hand, this moment won't last forever.
I want to you, kiss your sweet lips.
Can you feel the cliche, it's there in the air.
You feel the same desire. Same cliché.
But could we still do it?

Chorus
It burns, it's young desire.
It's fire, but easy die, though.
Can we do the things what mum and dad do?
Can we still do things what mum and dad do?
Can we do it like they.

Bridge
They refuse the first kiss
They want to try, but then something changes
and others don't see you as the same.
Want to play? Stay calm and start.

Never coming back to home,
tomorrow i'll be gone.

My canoe can cross this sea,
but I missed home already a week ago.

what's up, you've changed
everything is fine in here.




Poem "Surreal morning":
Morning coffee tastes good when the sun rises,
the most demanding work can be done before lunch,
yet I don't want pain when I go to bed.

Play and sing, I can hear your voice:
the song of the birds and the grasshoppers,
chord triad and last beat.
I played my guitar and broke the amp.

Where were you when we last saw each other?
What is written in the stars?
My tongue went into a knot when I corked the beer,
and this is not embarrassing in the light of the future,
to clarify, my world is in your words.




Poem "Specter":
Don't give me anything, I want your anger.
I already have my testicles ripped out of my soul.
Be the reason I cry and hug a woman in public
I want to be a weak troll who screams ugly.
I recognize mine from the starry sky,
the mirror image resembles my idol.
If you catch this rhythm,
love doesn't remain just a dream.




Poem "A brat living in a pillow":
You want to hurt me.
I am silenced by violence, by poison.
I don't think you'll get lucky then,
while teaching his own father to piss.
I have a thousand tricks:
one out of hundred works, one out of thousand wins,
and not everything can be revealed,
you must be given the opportunity to try.
A brat living in a pillow
doesn't know about the symptoms when the dog picks up the bone.
I went to the bottom, cut my braid and went to work,
but there are no further instructions.
I know how to carry on.
I have fooled you so many times that there is something to do.
I copied your pain and I won't die.
I'll take you to my place, I'll take you to my place.
