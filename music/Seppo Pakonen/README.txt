For anyone reading this:

My intention is to allow anyone to make new lyrics over my songs with liberal licensing.
I try to protect my copyright interest with these songs, but I also emphasis transparent process.

Even if you oppose my political view, I still welcome you to overwrite my lyrics.
I make lyrics from different viewpoints without necessarily agreeing on them.
I have a lot more affection to my muscial compositions than my lyrics.
I am personally a member of the Pirate Party of Finland, and that is quite apt because I also have a 15cm scar on my face and forehead.
I can't do the work that requires concentration because of the pain.
So please don't be woke or anti-woke about this, ok?

It took me years to perfect my own musical style in the midst of all the outside influence.
I received very minimal outside help, which is a good thing in retrospect, although it sometimes seemed unfortunate.
I'm happy if my music and lyricism affect the music that other people produce.
I have the impression that I do not have anything unusual minority identy compared to the average English-language global internet identity.
I don't see my generic identity as a threat or an opportunity.
My Finn's identity is quite unnoticeable to myself, and I can see it most when others have a strong opinion on the matter without any technical justification.
I clearly feel the white man's hatred for myself on the Internet, and I think that's unfair.
I very rarely remember being a white man when I make music or lyrics.
Here in northern Finland, we have a general feeling that we have been deprived for generations and that our tar and other work results have been taken at a mock price to Central Europe.
We do not feel any responsibility for the troubles of any other people because we have had so many of our own.

I am aware of the threats that the transparent process produces, and I know there is a risk that someone will steal my song.
My decision to keep the songs public is most influenced by the fact that I believe that a transparent process will ultimately do more good than harm.

I've had a lot of international friends in the real world and in the real-time virtual worlds of the Internet.
Here in Oulu, I have been friends with many international students born in '90.
For that, I can thank my good friend Jesse, who now lives in Austin, Texas.
I had to speak English since I was about 13 years old here.
The nicest women I can imagine being in this town is from that community.
On the Internet, I have used the following names: sblo, blob, sppp, paco, poco, loco and some others 4 character words.
I'm sure a lot of good guys will recognize me by them. Greetings.
I have been in linux online gaming communities since 2005, and have been active in the following communities: bzflags, nexuiz, xonotic, rexuiz, sauerbraten.
We have had a lot of really happy conversations.
I've been favoring real-time online communities over bulletin board-like services (Facebook, etc.) since then.

I still have a couple of really good friends left.
I'm more comfortable without hundreds of Facebook friends.
I abandoned them when I deleted my Facebook account.
I haven't regretted it.

Finally, I would like to mention that my favorite guitar manufacturer is HMI guitars based in India, Chennai.
I have an affordable Les Paul made by them, and it glows with distinctiveness. It has a really good price/quality ratio.
I've had more expensive guitars, but I've sold them off.
