Sor- ry, I don't have time to call your name
Got too much on my mind to feel no shame,
I'm long- in' for you, can't find a way to break free,
Ly- ing in the sand, sky as far as I can see
What we had was pure bliss, You made all my wish- es come
true with one kiss, Gone were the days,
when our love was blind
Hearts empty, no more left to find
Not feel- ing the vibes to- get- her,
Not ma- king sweet love to last for- e- ver
Your touch so soft it hyp- no- tized me,
My pas- sions set free, fire's all that I see
May- be I could have inc- reased my un- der- stand- ing,
but I know that we were both too de- man- ding,
In this life no re- grets, life must go on,
Strong- er than be- fore, em- brac- ing deep love

FOR TTS:

Sorry, I don't have time to call your name
Got too much on my mind to feel no shame,
I'm longing for you, 
can't find a way to break free,
Lying in the sand, sky as far as I can see

What we had was pure bliss,
You'll made all my wishes come true with one kiss,
Gone were the days, when our love was blind
Hearts empty, no moreleft to find

Not feeling the vibes together,
Not making sweet love to last forever
Your touch so soft, it hypnotized me
My passions set free, fire's all that I see

Maybe I could have increased my understanding,
but I know that we were both too demanding,
In this life no regrets, life must go on, 
Stronger than before, embracing deep love


No I didn't wanna battle 
wanna be apart
I never meant to make this happen in this way, 
no-no I
didn't want to hurt you 
wanna do this way but no matter how much love we got we hurt each other yet again


I took some time to clear my mind,
Till I was ready to be kind.
The breeze I left as I was walking away
Awaited another heart to make a brand new day

At first I was against the notion of us,
But our vibes and smiles created the trust
When your touch came with a pow,
Gettin' weak, no way to go slow

I'm scared of dipping in love's pool,
But I'm scared of failing then not going back to school.
Let me whisper in your ear, late in the night
Bring a sweetness to my life, and let take flight

I don't ever wanna feel these highs and lows alone,
Goin' further when two hearts connect, like a telephone,
I can't deny that you are all I desire,
But asking you to marry me may set us up for fire.


We knew that love would never stay, like ideas of yesterday
As hope fades away in morning dew, I don't know how to cope with you
I've been so afraid, to show what I feel deep down inside,
I've kept it caged, but now I'm done with all the little lies







ORIGINAL TRANSLATED

Chorus:
I didn't want to fight, I don't want to break up,
i never imagined this would end
I didn't mean to break you, to do this to us, but...
no matter how one loves the other, one hurts the other again


Verse 1:
Sorry honey I haven't called in a while
I've been busy and I've just recovered from work
I miss you and I want you here
to lie down on the beach when there are only stars above
I dream how you would be warm in my arms
I promised to stay with you through the ups and downs
Still, time passes by taking me away
your kisses are memories in my mind now
Like that vision of us touching
in wich I kiss you and we rock together
when the night gets dark, and the only thing I hear is you
the moon shines on you and you are drenched in sweat
I guess neither of us tried enough
because we came here and don't see enough of each other
I'll be back in a moment, come meet me wife
Let's be a little wiser so that we can love again


Verse 2:
I feel like I need someone else
I forget your name and I mess it up with another name
When I left with slamming doors last time,
a woman came up with an air of hope
I rejected the happy feelings,
but when our eyes met, the sorrows disappeared
How to turn off the feeling? I don't know
but sometimes it gets me, I won't deny
I'm afraid that I'll fall in love again
or that I fall in love, and fail and never recover
I don't want to fall in love with someone who immediately leaves
time is precious to spend alone with someone
And I don't want to ride the emotional roller coaster alone anymore,
but you can handle it when you share everything
I won't confess to you that you are my only one,
if you want, you will realize that you are my wife


Bridge:
Sometimes I said I was sorry, I wanted to forget the fights,
but they remain inside me, even if I don't notice it
I didn't show enough how much I cared
I can be nice to you again now, what would I fix with its







ORIGINAL FOR TRANSLATING


Kertosäe:
En tahtonut tapella, en tahdo erota,
en kuvitellut koskaan tän loppuvan,
en tahtonut sua rikkoo, tehdä meille näin mut vaik
kuinka toinen toistaan rakastaakin toinen toistaan jälleen satuttaa


Säe 1:
Anteeks kulta että en oo vähään aikaan soittanut
ollaan oltuu kiireisii ja työstä oon vain toipunut
Mul on ikävä ja haluisin sut tänne,
makoileen hiekal kun yllä on vain tähdet
Muistan kuinka sä oot lämmin mun sylissä
vannoin pysyy mukanas niissä eri mäissä,
Silti aika vierii pois mut vieden
suudelmat sun kaa on vain haamui mielen
Se ikuinen kosketuksen mielikuva, kun
suutelen sua ja me yhes keinutaan
ku ilta tummuu, ja kuulen vain sut
kuu loistaa sinuun ja hikeen kastut
Kai me molemmat on tehty liian vähän
kun tultiin tähän eikä tarpeeks nähä
Kohta vielä palaan taas, tule vaimo minua vastaan
Ollaan vähän viisaampii että voidaan taas rakastaa


Säe 2:
Tuntuu niinku tarvitsen  jonkun toisen
nimesi unohtuu minulla ja toiseen minä jo sen sotken
Kun minä viimeksi lähdin ovet paukkuen,
tuli minua vastaan eräs uutta toivoo huokuen
Mä yritin torjua tunteet,
mutta kun meidän katseet kohtasi, katos murheet
Miten tunteen sammutan,  en tiiä,
mutta otteeseen minut se saa,  en kiellä
Mä pelkään vähän sitä taas  että minä ihastun
tai että rakastun ja petyn enkä palaudu
En haluu rakastuu toiseen joka heti jättää
aika on arvokasta viettää kahdestaan jonkun kanssa
Enkä haluu enää yksin tunne-vuoristorataan,
mutta siitä kyllä selviää kun sen muiden kanssa jakaa
En sulle paljasta, että oot mun ainoa,
jos tahdot, niin sinä huomaat että olet minun vaimo


Bridge:
Välillä minä sanoin että minua kaduttaa, tahdoin riidat unohtaa,
mut ne säilyy ain sun sisällä, vaik mä en huomaiskaan
Mä näyttänyt en tarpeeksi, kuinka paljon välitin
Voin mä olla taas nyt mukava sinulle, mitä sillä korjaisin
