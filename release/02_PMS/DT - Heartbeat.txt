Verse 1:
Sorry, I don't have time to call your name
Got too much on my mind to feel no shame
I'm longin' for you, can't find a way to break free,
Lying in the sand, night sky as far as I can see.
What we had was pure bliss, You'll made all my
wishes come true with one kiss, But our love died
away, love broken like mist
No more winter nights, kisses become a mist
Not feeling the vibes together,
Not making sweet love to last, now and forever.
Your touch so soft, it hypnotized me
My passions set free, fire's all that I see
Maybe I could have increased my understanding,
but I know that we were both (a bit too ) demanding
In this life no regrets, life must go on,
Stronger than before, embracing deep love.

Chorus:
I didn't wanna battle
wanna be apart
I never meant for this to happen
in this way, and no I
didn't wanna hurt you
wanna do this way
but no matter how much love we got
we hurt each other yet again

Verse 2:
I shrugged away the emotion of pleasure,
But when our eyes met, joy returned as the treasure
Heart was strong and I couldn't pick it apart,
Loved it hard and I couldn't turn it off.
I shrugged away the emotion of pleasure,
But when our eyes met, joy returned as the treasure
Heart was strong and I couldn't pick it apart,
Loved it hard and I couldn't turn it off.
Love's an uphill battle, I'm scared of the fall
But I'm gonna take this risk, and answer the call
The love we need, could never be denied,
Cherish every moment, make sure we ride.
I don't ever wanna feel these highs and lows alone,
Goin' further when two hearts connect, like a telephone.
I know you're the pick for me, without no doubt,
But should I really take a chance and propose u now?

Bridge:
We knew that love would never stay,
Like ideas of yesterday,
As hope fades away in morning dew,
I don't know how to cope with you.
I've been so afraid, to show
what I feel deep down inside,
I've kept it caged, but now I'm done
with all the little lies.

Chorus:
I didn't wanna fight, wanna be apart
I never saw this coming for us in this way
and I didn't wanna hurt you, wanna do this way
but no matter how much love we got we hurt each other yet again

Verse 1:
I'm sorry, sweetheart, that I haven't called in a while,
Been so busy, been recovering, wasn't feeling so fine


EMINEM

Verse 1:
I'm sorry, sweetheart, that I haven't called in a while,
Been so busy, been recovering, wasn't feeling so fine
Miss you, want to get you here,
Laying in the sand, stars above 

I remember how you were, so warm in my arms,
Promised we would stay together through any harm,
Time passed us by, but our kisses remain,
Kissing you, rocking back and forth again 

As night goes dark, only you I hear,
Under the moonlight, sea is wet around us here,
We both didn't do enough, never could see,
Soon I'm coming back, come to me
Be a little wiser so we could love again

Verse 2:
Feeling like I need somebody else,
Name forgotten, another I felt,
When I came back slamming the door,
A new hope smelling at the floor,
Tried to cover up the feelings, our glances,
Erased all the trouble, but how to extinguish?
Don't know, but to its potency I yield, 
No denying that, don't even try to build
Fear a bit of being attracted, or falling for,
Failing again and not recovering for sure,
Don't want to fall for one who'd leave,
Time is too precious to keep,
Don't divulge to you that you're the only one,
If you want that, you'll feel like my wife anon

Bridge:
Sometime I told you that I'm sorry, wanted wrangles to bury,
But those will stay inside of your heart, even if I don't recognize
I might not have show enough how deeply I care,
Can I be nice again, and what I can repair?




DRAKE

Chorus:
Hate that I had to lead us to this sad place
I never thought for us it'd end this way
Didn't wanna hurt you, didn't wanna make us this way
How we love, sometimes it causes us to pain

Verse 1:
Sorry I ain't been around for a bit
Been kinda busy and still healing from it
I miss you, wanna have you here
Lay on the sand beach when the stars appear
I recall us warm in each other's arms
Swore I'd forever keep us from harm
But time flew by, that kiss still in my mind
Wrapped up in you, just swaying in time
As night came on, your soft voice strung
The moon shone over us drenched with dew
We both must have been doing too little
To keep this thing alive, to see what we could give
In time I'll come back, hoping by then
That we wise up and love again	

Verse 2:
Feels like I need somebody else
Names become a blur with somebody else
When I left last time, doors slamming shut
Saw someone filled with new hope and luck
Tried to mute my craving I just couldn't
Our gazes met and sadness flew
How to dim my passion, man I don't know
But it's taken me where I can't say no
Afraid to fall again, heavy and deep
Time is precious to give each other weeps
Don't wanna lose to someone who won't stay
Never let you know you were my only

Bridge:
Often I mention I'm sorry, wished I could take the fights away
But it lies deep within you, I'm too blind to see
I didn't give enough, so now how do I fix this
Can I ever be nice and get a homecoming kiss


ED SHEERAN

Chorus:
I didn't wanna argue, I wanted to be apart,
I never imagined this ending like this in my heart,
I didn't wanna break you, do this, caused it still hurts,
No matter how much we love each other, we can still hurt.

Verse 1:
Sorry, my love, I haven't been calling lately,
We've had so much to do and I was just recuperating,
I miss you so much, I want you close to my arms,
Lying on the beach, stars all around us like a charm,
I remember when you were so close, in my embrace,
I promised that I'd stay with you in different places,
But time passes by, and our kisses become just a ghost,
Our lips just a memory, feeling long lost,
But still, at night, I hear you near my side,
The moonlight cascading, our bodies wet with sweat inside,
I think we both let out too little,
It's too bad that neither of us saw it in the middle.

Verse 2:
It feels like I need someone else,
Names forgotten, and with others I'm already held,
When last I left, I came with a new hope in the air,
But the feelings, I tried to ignore, seemed to still be there,
How do I extinguish this lust, I don't know,
But it's something I can't resist, that I won't forgo,
I'm a little scared to fall for another again,
And to be let down, I can't bear it, to feel that pain,
I don't want to have to love someone, only for them to leave,
But time is precious, and I wanted it to be for us to share and believe,
No, I won't tell, that you were the one,
But if you'd like, then you can be my wife and my only one.

Bridge:
In between, I said, I'm so sorry, wanting to forget that fight,
But it's still there inside you, though I don't even realize. 
I never showed you enough, how much I truly care, 
Can I be nice again, and start from here?

Chorus:
I didn't want to fight, I don't want to break up,
i never imagined this would end
I didn't mean to break you, to do this to us, but...
no matter how one loves the other, one hurts the other again


Verse 1:
Sorry honey I haven't called in a while
I've been busy and I've just recovered from work
I miss you and I want you here
to lie down on the beach when there are only stars above
I dream how you would be warm in my arms
I promised to stay with you through the ups and downs
Still, time passes by taking me away
your kisses are memories in my mind now
Like that vision of us touching
in wich I kiss you and we rock together
when the night gets dark, and the only thing I hear is you
the moon shines on you and you are drenched in sweat
I guess neither of us tried enough
because we came here and don't see enough of each other
I'll be back in a moment, come meet me wife
Let's be a little wiser so that we can love again


Verse 2:
I feel like I need someone else
I forget your name and I mess it up with another name
When I left with slamming doors last time,
a woman came up with an air of hope
I rejected the happy feelings,
but when our eyes met, the sorrows disappeared
How to turn off the feeling? I don't know
but sometimes it gets me, I won't deny
I'm afraid that I'll fall in love again
or that I fall in love, and fail and never recover
I don't want to fall in love with someone who immediately leaves
time is precious to spend alone with someone
And I don't want to ride the emotional roller coaster alone anymore,
but you can handle it when you share everything
I won't confess to you that you are my only one,
if you want, you will realize that you are my wife


Bridge:
Sometimes I said I was sorry, I wanted to forget the fights,
but they remain inside me, even if I don't notice it
I didn't show enough how much I cared
I can be nice to you again now, what would I fix with its

Kertosäe:
En tahtonut tapella, en tahdo erota,
en kuvitellut koskaan tän loppuvan,
en tahtonut sua rikkoo, tehdä meille näin mut vaik
kuinka toinen toistaan rakastaakin toinen toistaan jälleen satuttaa


Säe 1:
Anteeks kulta että en oo vähään aikaan soittanut
ollaan oltuu kiireisii ja työstä oon vain toipunut
Mul on ikävä ja haluisin sut tänne,
makoileen hiekal kun yllä on vain tähdet
Muistan kuinka sä oot lämmin mun sylissä
vannoin pysyy mukanas niissä eri mäissä,
Silti aika vierii pois mut vieden
suudelmat sun kaa on vain haamui mielen
Se ikuinen kosketuksen mielikuva, kun
suutelen sua ja me yhes keinutaan
ku ilta tummuu, ja kuulen vain sut
kuu loistaa sinuun ja hikeen kastut
Kai me molemmat on tehty liian vähän
kun tultiin tähän eikä tarpeeks nähä
Kohta vielä palaan taas, tule vaimo minua vastaan
Ollaan vähän viisaampii että voidaan taas rakastaa


Säe 2:
Tuntuu niinku tarvitsen  jonkun toisen
nimesi unohtuu minulla ja toiseen minä jo sen sotken
Kun minä viimeksi lähdin ovet paukkuen,
tuli minua vastaan eräs uutta toivoo huokuen
Mä yritin torjua tunteet,
mutta kun meidän katseet kohtasi, katos murheet
Miten tunteen sammutan,  en tiiä,
mutta otteeseen minut se saa,  en kiellä
Mä pelkään vähän sitä taas  että minä ihastun
tai että rakastun ja petyn enkä palaudu
En haluu rakastuu toiseen joka heti jättää
aika on arvokasta viettää kahdestaan jonkun kanssa
Enkä haluu enää yksin tunne-vuoristorataan,
mutta siitä kyllä selviää kun sen muiden kanssa jakaa
En sulle paljasta, että oot mun ainoa,
jos tahdot, niin sinä huomaat että olet minun vaimo


Bridge:
Välillä minä sanoin että minua kaduttaa, tahdoin riidat unohtaa,
mut ne säilyy ain sun sisällä, vaik mä en huomaiskaan
Mä näyttänyt en tarpeeksi, kuinka paljon välitin
Voin mä olla taas nyt mukava sinulle, mitä sillä korjaisin
