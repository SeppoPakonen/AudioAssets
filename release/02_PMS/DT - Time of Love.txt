Verse 1:
Listen to me now, hear me loud
Be quiet, make no sound
I was wrong, so now I'm paying the price
Can't undo my mistakes not once, not twice
My words for you are full of affection,
But you've stopped listening like cut off connection.
I lost my trust for you tonight,
Colours once so bright, now black and white.
You spoke my name like it never had worth,
My property gone, all over this earth.
Slumber in peace, sleep til morning,
My mischief is here for you without warning.
But your heart is kind, I see it in your eyes,
Your loving embrace, sets my soul to rise.
We rarely get along, it's a hard rock life
Sex unites us though, I take it as no surprise

Chorus:
My sweet wife. Our home grew sweeter with time,
My sweet wife. With each kiss, no need to question why.
My sweet wife. Even though we shared the highs and lows
Go bye bye. Still, I just have to let you go

Verse 2:
Hey man, come try, won't be a good time,
My advice is to stay out of sight and mind
You toyed with me and did not care,
My broken heart no longer able to be fair.
Why'd you change, why'd love just fly away?
It's so depressing and I still remain here in dismay.
If you'd have stayed, I had enough of you,
But your leaving made me try something new.
Caught my eye, wouldn't deny,
Found temptation in your guy.
Gave myself a different kind of prize
All your cash was used to buy me some nice
Your selfishness brought this game, dude
I was your pride, your own tattoo
You cheated leaving me to cry,
No longer want you in my life.

Verse 3:
Our feuds just cause further confusion,
And all you do is spread the illusion.
Don't stand there and pretend that I'm to blame,
It was you who created the spark off the flame.
My wrongs I've stated, I tried to make it right,
But you kept me buried, kept me out of sight.
My rhymes have been heard in just a few streets
But your taco's been visited from city to city fleets
My worst regret was that I did not change
But I'm relieved, I'm free to range
I'm sipping on some ale to keep score,
About the fall of my love once more.
Time runs out before you said goodbye
but love still lingers when you think of me tonight
Alone in cold, still feeling alright,
My dreams stay alive, in this lonely night.

Verse 1:
Listen to me now, and be quiet
I was wrong and there was no point in arguing
I'm depressed when I'm under the same roof
please heal it and also disappear at the same time
I would say this lovingly, but
you don't listen to me because you turned into a difficult person
I lost my trust, honey
honey, you took the colors away from me
You gossiped about me and you mocked me in my hearing
you took our money and sold my property
Sleep peacefully and stay resting
I would like to make your resting permanent
but still I want to caress you
sleep in a spoon like the first night together
Damn, life with you is rubbish, but the sex sweeten it so I don't notice

Chorus:
Hello wife, love made our home
Hey wife, the heat can't stay up without a flame
Hey wife, we did everything for this
Go, bye bye, still I'll stay away from you forever

Verse 2:
Hey man, come here, I'll give you a bit of a hard time
I grab your testicles with my nails, squeezing
I bet you broke us up on purpose
you broke my heart and me along with it
Why did you change? where is the love?
You brag even though your salary is unemployment compensation
Sorry, yes you were enough, and I was hoping you would come back
but you stayed away and I found someone else to hug for a long time
I was sneaky and you didn't notice
that your friend had been drooling over me for a long time
I rewarded myself with a southern holiday and
I paid from a joint account when you were just lounging on the sofa
You are the only one to blame and you already understand that
I was your wife and you were proud of me
however, you were an asshole, you cheated on me, and
I can't stand you anymore

Verse 3:
Our quarrel always leads to worse quarrels
I'm for the family, but you went to the party again
Oh, I'm a braggart, it doesn't hurt to slander
you were the one compared to the rest of us
Sorry, I did make mistakes
but I still felt the same way when you started being mean
Hello, my penis has only been food in the neighborhood
your vagina's distribution is of the same class as the whole of Finland
The worst mistake was to maintain hope,
on/off repeat, it's off now with porn
Maybe I'll drown my sorrows in beer
and I may forget my woman temporarily
You wanted to leave and then you wanted to go back to bed
the door opens one way with my latest keys
It's cold alone, the gray mark is from our separation, I'm sure I'll still feel at ease alone

Säe 1:
Kuuntele mua nyt,  ja oo hiljaa
olin vääräs  ja oli turha kiista
oon masentunu kun oon saman katon alla
pliis paranna se ja myös häivy pois samalla
Sanoisin tän rakastavasti, mutta
sä et siihen vastaa, ku muutuit noita-akaksi
Menetin luottamuksen suhun kulta
rakas,  sä veit värit pois minulta
Juorusit pahaa ja pilkkasit mun edessä
otit meidän rahat ja tuhlasit sen hetkessä
Nukahda rauhassa ja  pysy lepäämäs
tekis mieli olla ilman heräämistäs näkemäs
mutta silti mä haluun sua hyväillä
peiton alla olla niinku ekana yönä yhessä
Perkele mitä roskaa elämä sinun kanssasi onkaan mut muistot makeuttaa sen nii en huomaa

Kertosäe:
Vaimo hei, rakkaudesta meidän koti tehtiin
Vaimo hei, ei lämpö pysy yllä ilman liekkii
Vaimo hei, me tehtiin tän eteen kaikki
Mene, hei hei, silti susta pysyn erossa ikuisesti

Säe 2:
Mies hei, tule tänne, sua vähän rankasen
otan kiinni kiveksistäsi kynsillä puristaen
Mä tiiän että sä särit meidät tarkoituksella
särit mun sydämen ja mut sen mukana
Miks sä muutuit? Mihin tuntees katos?
Kehuskelet vaan vaikka et lyö rahoiks
Sori, kyllä sinä riitit, ja toivoin sun palaavan
mut sä pysyit pois ja löysin toisen pitkään halaamaan
olin viekas ja  sä et huomannut
et sun kaverisi oli kauan mua kuolannut
palkitsin itseni  etelän lomalla ja
maksoin yhteistililtä ku ryyppäsit vain sohvalla
Sä oot ainut syypää ja se jo ymmärrä
olin sinun vaimo ja olit siitä ylpeä
kuitenkin olit kusipää, petkutit minua , ja
en enää ala sietään sua enempää

Säe 3:
Meidän riita johtaa aina  riitoihin pahempiin
mä oon perheen puolesta mut sinä taas lähdit bileisiin
ai mä oon kehuskelija, ei osu herjas ku
sähän olit meistä se joka muihin vertas
Anteeks,  mä tein kyllä virheitä
mut mä silti tunsin samoin kun sä aloit ilkeillä
Hei, mun penis on ollut vain lähialueen ruokaa ku
sun vagina jakelu on koko suomen luokkaa
Pahin virhe oli ylläpitää toivoa,
on/off toistumista, se on nyt off ja minulla on pornoa
Saatampa minä kaataa kurkkuuni olutta
minä saatan ottaa tilapäistä unohdusta naiseeni
Tahoit pois ja sit tahoit sänkyyn takasin
yhteen suuntaan ovi käy  nyt uusin avaimin
Yksin kylmää on, harmaa jälki on erostamme, varmaan yksinään mä silti saan olon helpon
