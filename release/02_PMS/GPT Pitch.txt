1. Song: Heartbeat

Chorus:
I didn't want to fight, I don't want to break up,
i never imagined this would end
I didn't mean to break you, to do this to us, but...
no matter how one loves the other, one hurts the other again


Verse 1:
Sorry honey I haven't called in a while
I've been busy and I've just recovered from work
I miss you and I want you here
to lie down on the beach when there are only stars above
I dream how you would be warm in my arms
I promised to stay with you through the ups and downs
Still, time passes by taking me away
your kisses are memories in my mind now
Like that vision of us touching
in wich I kiss you and we rock together
when the night gets dark, and the only thing I hear is you
the moon shines on you and you are drenched in sweat
I guess neither of us tried enough
because we came here and don't see enough of each other
I'll be back in a moment, come meet me wife
Let's be a little wiser so that we can love again


Verse 2:
I feel like I need someone else
I forget your name and I mess it up with another name
When I left with slamming doors last time,
a woman came up with an air of hope
I rejected the happy feelings,
but when our eyes met, the sorrows disappeared
How to turn off the feeling? I don't know
but sometimes it gets me, I won't deny
I'm afraid that I'll fall in love again
or that I fall in love, and fail and never recover
I don't want to fall in love with someone who immediately leaves
time is precious to spend alone with someone
And I don't want to ride the emotional roller coaster alone anymore,
but you can handle it when you share everything
I won't confess to you that you are my only one,
if you want, you will realize that you are my wife


Bridge:
Sometimes I said I was sorry, I wanted to forget the fights,
but they remain inside me, even if I don't notice it
I didn't show enough how much I cared
I can be nice to you again now, what would I fix with its




2. Song: Time of Love

Verse 1:
Listen to me now, and be quiet
I was wrong and there was no point in arguing
I'm depressed when I'm under the same roof
please heal it and also disappear at the same time
I would say this lovingly, but
you don't listen to me because you turned into a difficult person
I lost my trust, honey
honey, you took the colors away from me
You gossiped about me and you mocked me in my hearing
you took our money and sold my property
Sleep peacefully and stay resting
I would like to make your resting permanent
but still I want to caress you
sleep in a spoon like the first night together
Damn, life with you is rubbish, but the sex sweeten it so I don't notice

Chorus:
Hello wife, love made our home
Hey wife, the heat can't stay up without a flame
Hey wife, we did everything for this
Go, bye bye, still I'll stay away from you forever

Verse 2:
Hey man, come here, I'll give you a bit of a hard time
I grab your testicles with my nails, squeezing
I bet you broke us up on purpose
you broke my heart and me along with it
Why did you change? where is the love?
You brag even though your salary is unemployment compensation
Sorry, yes you were enough, and I was hoping you would come back
but you stayed away and I found someone else to hug for a long time
I was sneaky and you didn't notice
that your friend had been drooling over me for a long time
I rewarded myself with a southern holiday and
I paid from a joint account when you were just lounging on the sofa
You are the only one to blame and you already understand that
I was your wife and you were proud of me
however, you were an asshole, you cheated on me, and
I can't stand you anymore

Verse 3:
Our quarrel always leads to worse quarrels
I'm for the family, but you went to the party again
Oh, I'm a braggart, it doesn't hurt to slander
you were the one compared to the rest of us
Sorry, I did make mistakes
but I still felt the same way when you started being mean
Hello, my penis has only been food in the neighborhood
your vagina's distribution is of the same class as the whole of Finland
The worst mistake was to maintain hope,
on/off repeat, it's off now with porn
Maybe I'll drown my sorrows in beer
and I may forget my woman temporarily
You wanted to leave and then you wanted to go back to bed
the door opens one way with my latest keys
It's cold alone, the gray mark is from our separation, I'm sure I'll still feel at ease alone
