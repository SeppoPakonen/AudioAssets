Verse 1:
We used to be enemies, but the music brings us together,
it's like a healing remedy.
And as I take your hand, everything just falls away,
all those past mistakes, they don't matter today.
And in this moment, all our pain and strife, fades away

Pre-chorus 1:
as we embrace the beauty of music's life.
And as our voices blend, our harmonies collide

Chorus 1:
In this harmony, we've found a brand new start,
leaving the past behind and healing every scar.
Through our music, we found a way to mend,
a friendship that once seemed to have no end,
no end

Verse 2:
We used to throw daggers with our words, tearing each other down,
now we use our music to build each other up and turn our frowns.
Now we use our melodies to bridge the gap,
and our lyrics are the bridge that brings us back
and our melodies are the glue that keeps us on track

Pre-chorus 1:
With one voice, we embrace the beauty of music's life
and as our voices blend, our harmonies collide

Chorus 1:
In this harmony, we've found a brand new start,
leaving the past behind and healing every scar.
Through our music, we found a way to mend,
a friendship that once seemed to have no end,
no end

Bridge 1:
Singing in perfect harmony, two souls now intertwined,
our past differences fading, as our music unites.
Together in perfect harmony, our differences no longer divide,
our music has become our guide, as we leave the past behind.

Chorus 1:
In this harmony, we've found a brand new start,
leaving the past behind and healing every scar.
Through our music, we found a way to mend,
a friendship that once seemed to have no end,
a bond that can't be broken
