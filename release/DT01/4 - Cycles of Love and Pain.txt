Chorus:
Have a nice rest of your life, we keep playing this game,
I can't keep living in this cycle of pain.
We kept playing this game, hoping for a different outcome,
but it's time to leave this cycle behind.

Verse 1:
I try to keep my cool, but your touch makes me shiver,
it's like a drug I can't resist, a wilful quiver.
But deep down I know it's all just a game,
with no real winner or prize to claim.
I want to break free from these chains,
find my own track and leave you behind, like a train.
'cus every time we try, it's like throwing gasoline on a flame,
just adding more fuel to this burning game.
caught in this endless cycle, we can't seem to break,
but it's time to admit that this cycle's a mistake.
I' ll find my own way,
no more love to pay.
'cus every time we try, it's like two trains on a collision course,
our love's a breaking force that leaves us both feeling remorse.
At least we both feel remorse

Chorus:
Have a nice rest of your life, we keep playing this game,
I can't keep living in this cycle of pain.
We kept playing this game, hoping for a different outcome,
but it's time to leave this cycle behind.

Verse 2:
Our love was like a train, always heading off the tracks,
never knowing when the next collision would bring us back.
But every time we try, we're just chasing our own tails, 
stuck in this endless game that always fails.
Now I can't shake this feeling, this emotional ride,
it's like a drug that I can't deny, no matter how hard I've tried.
But as the tracks unravel, we're left with just the scars

Chorus:
Have a nice rest of your life, we keep playing this game,
I can't keep living in this cycle of pain.
We kept playing this game, hoping for a different outcome,
but it's time to leave this cycle behind.

Verse 3:
And as we keep spinning in this vicious dance,
I can't help but wonder if our love stood a chance.
We were always caught between love and pain,
riding a rollercoaster that never seemed to end.
But as we keep spinning in this vicious dance, I realize it's time to take a chance,
and break free from this endless trance.
On this journey of love and pain, we've danced a thousand times,
but it's time to break this endless cycle

Chorus:
Have a nice rest of your life, we keep playing this game,
I can't keep living in this cycle of pain.
We kept playing this game, hoping for a different outcome,
but it's time to leave this cycle behind.
