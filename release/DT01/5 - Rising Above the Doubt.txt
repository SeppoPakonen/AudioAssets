Verse 1:
They say I'm living a life of lies,
but I'm just breaking free, no longer bound by ties.
I used to walk on eggshells, afraid to speak my mind,
but now I'm breaking free, leaving all the doubts behind.
They said I couldn't do it

Chorus:
We're diamonds in the rough, but we shine so bright,
they can't dim our light
So don't you let them dim our shine,
we'll rise above every time.

Verse 2:
I used to chase after validation, seeking approval in everything I'd do,
but now I've found my worth within myself, and I don't need anyone to tell me the truth.
I used to chase after shadows, always searching for something more,
but now I've found my peace within, and I don't need to keep score.
Every step I take, is opening a new door
Now I can shout my worth, and I won't be tamed.

Chorus:
We're diamonds in the rough, but we shine so bright,
they can't dim our light
So don't you let them dim our shine,
we'll rise above every time.

Bridge:
I don't need their validation, I found my own worth,
and with you by my side, I'll conquer the earth
your love is the only thing that makes me whole

Chorus:
We're diamonds in the rough, but we shine so bright,
they can't dim our light
So don't you let them dim our shine,
we'll rise above every time.

We're diamonds in the rough, but we shine so bright,
they can't dim our light
So don't you let them dim our shine,
we'll rise above every time.

We're diamonds in the rough
they can't dim our light
we'll rise above every time.
