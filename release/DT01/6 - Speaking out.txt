Verse 1:
They call me crazy, but I'd rather be called insane
when I'm spitting truths, setting fires to the false chains.
They try to keep us in the dark, but I've got my flashlight shining bright
exposing all the lies and manipulation, I won't let them win this fight.

Chorus:
I'm not just another face, I've got a mind that's blazing,
I'll speak the truth, no matter what it's saying.
I've seen the truth, it's not what you've been fed,
I'll keep speaking out, won't let the lies spread.

Verse 2:
I've been labeled as an outcast, but I'll wear that title with pride,
'cause I've got a mind of my own, and I won't let it be denied.
They call me a conspiracy theorist, but I know what's really going on,
I've done my research and I won't be swayed.

Chorus:
I'm not just another face, I've got a mind that's blazing,
I'll speak the truth, no matter what it's saying.
I've seen the truth, it's not what you've been fed,
I'll keep speaking out, won't let the lies spread.

I'm not just another face, I've got a mind that's blazing,
I'll speak the truth, no matter what it's saying.
I've seen the truth, it's not what you've been fed,
I'll keep speaking out, won't let the lies spread.

Bridge:
But I'll keep speaking my truth, even if it makes them uncomfortable,
'cause I know deep down they can't handle the facts that we uncover.
And I'll keep pushing through the fear,
I'll be the voice for those who can't speak,
My mind is a maze, but I'm not lost,
I'll find my way Through all the noise and chaos,
the truth will still stay.

Chorus:
I'm not just another face, I've got a mind that's blazing,
I'll speak the truth, no matter what it's saying.
I've seen the truth, it's not what you've been fed,
I'll keep speaking out, won't let the lies spread.

I'm not just another face,
I'll speak the truth,
I'll keep speaking out, won't let the lies spread.

Outro:
I'm not like the others
I'm not like the others
I'm not like the others
