Verse 1:
Scrolling through my phone and seeing your face,
but now I know the truth, and it's a bitter taste.
I see her dancing, got no choice but to watch in awe,
a beautiful puppet, controlled by their law.
I stumble again, feeling like a fool,
realizing this is just a dark game they rule.
My head spins and I try to make sense, but
it's just a cruel game played at our expense.

Pre-Chorus 1:
Every sip of this drink tells a different truth,
revealing the harsh reality and the painful proof.

Chorus:
How did this happen?
How did this happen?
We've been sold and robbed,
stripped of our passion.
We're all just pawns,
manipulated by those in power.

Verse 2:
And as the night goes on, I watch more and more chips fall,
revealing the dark underbelly of this twisted game they call.
She swings her hips and twirls her hair, under their control she's unaware,
her body used as a commodity, just another pawn for them to see

Pre-chorus 2:
just another pawn in a game we never knew we were playing,
used and discarded, it's sickening and dismaying.
But as I stare into my glass, I see the lies and deceit,
realizing this game is rigged, nothing we can beat.

Chorus:
How did this happen?
How did this happen?
We've been sold and robbed,
stripped of our passion.
We're all just pawns,
manipulated by those in power.

Bridge:
As the night goes on, I see her fading away,
just a pawn in this twisted game they play.
And as I sit here and watch her fade,
my heart aches for the choices she's made

Chorus:
How did this happen?
How did this happen?
We've been sold and robbed,
stripped of our passion.
We're all just pawns,
manipulated by those in power.

Outro:
Stumbling out
into the night
Stumbling out
of this twisted game
