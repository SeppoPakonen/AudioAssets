Verse 1:
Always chasing thrills, never slowing down,
but when I'm with you, I wanna stay grounded.
and when I'm with you, my heart settles down,
and I realize what I truly have found,
a love that's honest, passionate and true,
baby, I'm stuck with you,
and I wouldn't want it any other way.
I may be flying high, but my heart feels so light,

Pre-chorus 1:
when I'm with you, everything just feels right.
Take me away

Chorus:
I'll melt in your arms tonight,
just like a fever that can't be fought or denied,
I may be flying high, but I'll always come back to you,
baby, I'm stuck with you,
there's nothing I can do,
there's nothing I can do.

Verse 2:
When I'm with you, all my fears disappear,
and I know that you're the one I truly hold dear.
with you by my side, I feel unbreakable,
like nothing can bring us down.
When I'm stuck with you, every moment feels like a thrill,
I never want to come down from this love high we've built.
But with you by my side, I feel unstoppable,

Pre-chorus 2:
our love is unbreakable
it's unshakable
Take me away

Chorus:
I'll melt in your arms tonight,
just like a fever that can't be fought or denied,
I may be flying high, but I'll always come back to you,
baby, I'm stuck with you,
there's nothing I can do,
there's nothing I can do

Bridge:
Though we may face obstacles along the way,
I know our love will always lead the way,
we'll stand strong and never give in,
because my heart always knows where to begin.
Take me away

Chorus:
I'll melt in your arms tonight,
just like a fever that can't be fought or denied,
I may be flying high, but I'll always come back to you,
baby, I'm stuck with you,
I'll melt in your arms tonight,
just like a fever that can't be fought or denied,
I may be flying high, but I'll always come back to you,
baby, I'm stuck with you,
there's nothing I can do,
there's nothing I can do
