[Verse 1]
You was once mine, but now you all tied
My heart still aches watching your ring shine bright
Sunset memories, we were young and in love 
My high school lover, now just a distant thought
I ain't sorry, feeling naughty, let's get lit
Your light got me crazy, want more of it
You want to share your scars, unlock your heart's key
I'll hold you down, baby, we'll take the pain and flee

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' young again

[Verse 2]
Thought we moved on, left it in the past
But when we're together, feels like it's meant to last
Thought we had it all, but it slipped away
Will we ever go back to those good old days?
Bae, my sign say proceed with caution
But when we together, it's like a love explosion
Had to cut ties, time to boss up and shine
Now I'm on top, doin' big things, on my city grind

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' like young again

[Bridge]
Thought you'd remember, our love was once the truth
But now I see, I'm better off without you in my youth
You say I changed, but I'm just livin' my truth
Embracing my desires, I'm not afraid to move

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' like a young woman

Old flames never die
Old flames never die

You was once mine, but now you all tied
My heart still aches watching your ring shine bright
Sunset memories, we were young and in love
My high school lover, now just a distant thought
I ain't sorry, feeling naughty, let's get lit
Your light got me crazy, want more of it
You want to share your scars, unlock your heart's key
I'll hold you down, baby, we'll take the pain and flee

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feelin' so damn lonely, wanna be your favorite
Baby, turn me on 'til I just can't take it
Tastin' your lips, can't resist, now I'm all in
In your arms, I'm lost, can't help but fall again

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' like a young man

[Verse 2]
Thought we moved on, left it in the past
But when we're together, feels like it's meant to last
Thought we had it all, but it slipped away

Bae, my sign say proceed with caution
But when we together, it's like a love explosion
Had to cut ties, time to boss up and shine
Now I'm on top, doin' big things, on my city grind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't you dare hold back, jump into the unknown
The risk and the thrill, baby, we're grown
We used to be tight, like birds of a feather
Now we're starin' at the sunset, and it's like we're together forever.

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' like a young man

[Bridge]
Thought you'd remember, our love was once the truth
But now I see, I'm better off without you in my youth
You say I changed, but I'm just livin' my truth
Embracing my desires, I'm not afraid to move

[Chorus]
Old flames never die, they just ignite
If you stay here, we'll turn up all night
You take me back, where it all began
I'm in your arms, feelin' like a young man
