[Verse 1, male singing]
Turns out we didn't need to talk, just have sex
But my heart's still broken, just an empty reflex
Wanted a bad boy, she got what she wished
But my heart can't handle her viciousness
Had me hypnotized, but I snapped out of it
No more playing your games, I've got my own shit
Heart like a diamond, I ain't breaking for you
Laughing all the way, while you're playing the fool

[Pre-Chorus 1, male singing]
Money talkin', boy, she ain't playin'
Ready for the pressure, got me swayin'
She's like a drug, can't break the habit
Her spell on me, I'm an addict for her magic

[Chorus, male singing]
Boss bitch, ain't gotta prove nothin'
Can't tell me shit, I'm livin' for lovin'
A hundred degrees, our bodies collide
Tonight, your touch is what I need to survive

[Verse 2, female singing]
You know how I like it when we grind all night
All that love and sweat, baby we ignite
Designer from head to toe, ain't no joke
He knows he wants me, can't deny the stroke
I try to resist, but your hold is too strong
Your scent, your moans, they've got me all wrong. 
No need for words, just show me with your touch
And I'll give you everything, never too much

[Pre-Chorus 2, male singing]
All night long, we keep it hot
Stamina, never gonna stop
She know she got it, scream one last time
I'll make her mine, fuck her from behind

[Chorus, male singing]
Boss bitch, ain't gotta prove nothin'
Can't tell me shit, I'm livin' for lovin'
A hundred degrees, our bodies collide
Tonight, your touch is what I need to survive

[Chorus, male singing]
Boss bitch, ain't gotta prove nothin'
Can't tell me shit, I'm livin' for lovin'
A hundred degrees, our bodies collide
Tonight, your touch is what I need to survive

[Bridge, male & female singing]
(female) From Satan's daughter to a boss bitch, that's me
(male) Convinced me to love her, now I can't be free
(male) She beggin' for the dick, can't get enough
(female) But I ain't no plaything, I'm too tough.
(female) I done did it, every day I'm fallin'
(male) Give in to her ways, my heart keeps callin'
(male) Speak my truth, I don't need no filter
(female) Don't try to play me, I ain't no quitter

[Chorus, male singing] 
Boss bitch, ain't gotta prove nothin'
Can't tell me shit, I'm livin' for lovin'
A hundred degrees, our bodies collide
Tonight, your touch is what I need to survive

[Chorus, male singing]
Boss bitch, ain't gotta prove nothin'
Can't tell me shit, I'm livin' for lovin'
A hundred degrees, our bodies collide
Tonight, your touch is what I need to survive
