Verse 1:
Our love is like a wildflower, untamed and free,
but we'll always find our way back, to our little paradise by the sea.
In our little paradise, where the world fades away,
our love shines like the sun, guiding us every day.

Pre-Chorus 1:
I'll hold your hand through every high and low,
our love will only continue to grow.

Chorus:
Together we'll build our dreams, in our little world,
our love will bloom and never fade, our hearts forever curled.
(x2)
Our love is like a symphony, playing in perfect harmony,
let's make our little paradise, where our love will forever be.

Verse 2:
Tucked away in our little abode,
our love knows no limits, it's simply untold.
In this little paradise, we escape from reality,
finding solace in our peaceful harmony.

Pre-Chorus 2:
Our love is like a rare treasure, hidden away from the world,
guarded and cherished, our bond unfurled.

Chorus:
Together we'll build our dreams, in our little world,
our love will bloom and never fade, our hearts forever curled.
(x2)
Our love is like a symphony, playing in perfect harmony,
let's make our little paradise, where our love will forever be.

Bridge:
Our little paradise is where we've made our home,
with you by my side, I'll never feel alone.
Our little paradise, where we built our love from the ground up,
nurtured with care and overflowing with boundless love.

Chorus:
Together we'll build our dreams, in our little world,
our love will bloom and never fade, our hearts forever curled.
(x4)
Our love is like a symphony, playing in perfect harmony,
lets make our little paradise, where our love will forever be.
will forever be.
