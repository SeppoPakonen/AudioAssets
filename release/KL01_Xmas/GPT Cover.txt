Christmas has a special meaning
every heart starts really beating
time to get together for a while

when it's time to write a song
topic's gotta come along
now it's time to invent something new

I'm gonna write a song
a christmas song
now it won't take long
till it is done
I'm gonna write a song
a christmas song
for you

As the years go by and by
Christmas could almost die
traditions will completely change

Could music save our Christmas
remind us how much good it does
classics will live eternally

I need another gift from heaven
a small but effective hook number seven
then some wise thoughts as lyrics down
and then let go, oh yeah
