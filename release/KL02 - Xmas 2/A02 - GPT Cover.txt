Song 1: Wonderful Christmas Peace

I wake up to the same reality
darkness on the ground shamefully
where is the snow when it should be
covering the ground
	 
People rushing round busily
buying everything thruthfully
everyone seeks a way to live
and soon the time will come

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace

Children are anxiously waiting
what if Santa brings them nothing
mothers and fathers have warned
not to be mean

when they get older, understanding
they should remain loving
the whole world could be much better
if Santa was real

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace

Come and let your worries fall behind
relax and have a really calmful mind

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace



Song 2: Dancing With The Santa

Verse 1:
sun goes down and darkness falls
minds are blue 'til someone calls
hey get here down to the arena
take the girls and boys with ya
santa's here and we're gonna have some fun

Chorus:
wooo, let's go
wooo, let's go
wooo, let's go
dancing with Santa

Verse 2:
the place is filled with claps and bows
a joyful crowd rocks this house
all around children are screaming
even grumpy old Tim is laughing
come on everyone get down to the floor

Bridge:
many of you can't see the show
time's up and soon Santa has to go
but the whole event will be saved and streamed just for you all




List of descriptions of the album's cover image for the generative image AI:
- "The album cover features 60 years old caucasian female in a cozy, winter setting. She is dressed in a red and white knitted sweater with snowflakes and reindeer pattern, holding a cup of hot cocoa with a candy cane stirrer. Behind her, we can see a Christmas tree decorated with lights and ornaments, and a fireplace with stockings hanging. The background is a snowy landscape with pine trees and a starry night sky."
- "Kaisu Leinone stands in front of a rustic wooden cabin, dressed in a fur-lined coat and a Santa hat. She holds a lantern in one hand and a small evergreen tree in the other. The cabin's windows are glowing with warm light, and snow covers the surrounding trees and ground. In the distance, we can see a sleigh pulled by reindeer flying through the night sky."
- "The album cover features a simple yet striking image of Kaisu Leinone, standing in a snowy field with the moon shining above her. She wears a long red dress and a white knitted scarf, with a snowflake design. The snow crunches under her boots as she gazes up at the stars, with a sense of peacefulness and wonder on her face."
- "Kaisu Leinone sits on a rocking chair on a porch, overlooking a frozen lake. She is bundled up in a plaid blanket, holding a guitar in her lap. The sky is a beautiful blend of pink and purple as the sun sets, casting a warm glow on the winter scene. In the background, we can see a silhouetted figure walking towards the cabin, with a small Christmas tree in hand."
- "A whimsical scene is depicted on the album cover, with Kaisu Leinone riding in a sleigh pulled by a team of magical reindeer. They fly through the night sky, with the Northern Lights shimmering above them. Kaisu wears a long green coat and a red scarf, with a smile on her face as she takes in the stunning sights. The sleigh is filled with presents and a giant Christmas tree, making it look like a scene straight out of a fairytale."
