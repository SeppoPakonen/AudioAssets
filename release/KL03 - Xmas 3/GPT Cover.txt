Song 1: The Biggest Christmas Tree

Verse 1:
Now as we've finally reached this Christmas
I wanna surprise you all
wait until you see what I've got in my yard
you'll be surprised one and all

Chorus:
I've got the biggest Christmas tree in the world
and all it's decorations are pure gold
I've got the biggest Christmas tree in the world
and it's shines bright like Rudolph's nose

I took this once in a lifetime chance
to amaze the whole world

a wonder in the world

in the dark Christmas night
my tree shines miles high
it's going to guide Santa's sleigh right




Song 2: This Christmas Night

Verse 1:
It's already a long way behind
and a new year ahead.
You never know what the new one will bring.
It's time for a new dawn,
you don't worry your loved ones:
I want a better home and I do.

Chorus:
It's Christmas night
so quiet
It's Christmas night
and its hope remains.
It's Christmas Eve,
night of magic.
Now for love
let me breathe

Verse 2:
When the year is about to change
and everyday challenges change,
what promise can i make
You can leave your worries behind.
Now let's make a new story
and I can create a new way of living.

Bridge:
When will the world find a way,
what does peace take every day?
Mmmm...mmmm...mmmm...aaaaaa




Song 3: Christmas Lights

Verse 1:
Winter comes after autumn.
Christmas in my heart again
the sun shines in the dark.
I hope people understand
in every country this;
I swear I will do everything today.

Chorus:
The lights make Christmas shine.
The lights of Christmas shine again.
Christmas lights for everyone, let them shine.
Christmas lights for you,
the lights make Christmas for me,
the lights of Christmas can already shine for us.

Verse 2:
New Year is around the corner,
make it a miracle again;
the sooner the change would arrive.
Rest is necessary for people,
to be ready to smile.
After difficulties, this is the best.

Bridge:
Do you already see this truth
everyone is needed.
Let the light shine into every heart;
my blue globe is changing.
