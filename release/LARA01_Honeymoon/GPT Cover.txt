Verse 1:
Weekday morning, coffee, daily newspaper
One takes the dog out, the first one who has time to do it
A quick kiss on the cheek, work calls again
The same rhythm repeats itself every day

Prechorus 1:
Although you are still my best and dearest
Could you bring back the initial love?
It would be like we were seeing each other for the first time
We would be stuck with each other for a month

Chorus:
Let's decide that every January
would be our very own Honeymoon
We would always return to those feelings
Which we had when we met for the first time
The first month of every year
It would bury our too smooth everyday life

Verse 2:
Weekend evening, wine and candlelight
The children have been put to bed, we can finally unwind
In the midst of the chaos, work and chores
We find each other, just like when we were first in love

Prechorus 2: 
Although our days may seem mundane and ordinary
Let's make our January extraordinary 
No need for fancy dinners or fancy champagne 
With each other, we'll feel like royalty again 

Bridge:
We don't need a fancy trip or extravagant gifts
Just setting some time aside for us is enough
In January, we'll focus on what matters most
And that is our love, forever and always
