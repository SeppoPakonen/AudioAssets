Intro:
My heart was open, but you took it for granted
thought you were the one, but now I've been disenchanted.

Verse 1:
Thought we had a connection,
but it was all just one-sided,
now I see the truth, it was all just
lies and pretense divided.
Thought I had finally
found my forever,
but you only saw me as
a temporary endeavor.

Thought I was your queen,
but you treated me like a pawn,
constantly hurt and used,
but now I'm finally moving on.
I was blinded by your charms,
but now I see the cracks,
Thought we were building a future,
but you were just busy tearing me down

Chorus:
I was your all, but to me,
you were nothing but a fall.
AND now I see the truth,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con
AND now I see the truth,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con

Verse 2:
But now I see the real you,
hiding behind the facade,
You never gave me the love
I truly desired
and I see that now, so flawed.
I won't let your betrayal break me,
I'll rise above and find my own destiny.
Your lies and deceit,
they were my breaking point,
thoughts of you still haunt me,
but I'll heal and anoint.

Chorus:
I was your all, but to me,
you were nothing but a fall.
AND now I see the truth,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con,
AND now I see the truth

Bridge:
I won't let your betrayal break me,
I'll rise above and find my own destiny
Now I see you for who you truly are,
a player in a game of love,
but I won't let you leave me scarred.

Chorus:
I was your all, but to me,
you were nothing but a fall.
AND now I see the truth,
you were nothing but a con

Chorus:
I was your all, but to me,
you were nothing but a fall.
AND now I see the truth,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con,
you were nothing but a con

Outro:
But I won't let your betrayal define me,
I'll rise above and find my own destiny
and leave you behind
