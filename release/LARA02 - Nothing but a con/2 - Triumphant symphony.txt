Verse 1:
Looking back at the past,
I see how far I've come,
and I know I'm better off
without those who once left me numb.

Every scar and every tear,
only reminds
me of the strength
that's always been here.

Through the pain and the struggle,
I found my voice,
and now I'm standing tall,
it's my choice.

I'm unstoppable,
I've got nothing to hide,
my strength shines through,
I won't be denied.


Chorus:
I won't let anyone hold me back,
I am my own strength and I won't crack,
my truth is my power,
it's what I lack.
I don't need anyone's validation,
my strength is my salvation,
I'll stand tall and proud,
my inner fire blazing,
I am the one who's left standing,
triumphant and free,
my own hero,
that's all I'll ever need.


Verse 2:
I used to think I needed someone else,
to make me whole and take away my pain,
but now I know, I've always been complete,
and that's the truth that keeps me sane.

They said I couldn't do it on my own,
that I needed someone by my side,
but now I see, I've always been enough,
my own strength, my own guide.


Chorus:
I won't let anyone hold me back,
I am my own strength and I won't crack,
my truth is my power,
it's what I lack.
I don't need anyone's validation,
my strength is my salvation,
I'll stand tall and proud,
my inner fire blazing


Bridge:
I used to think I needed you,
but now I see, I'm better off alone,
with my strength and my truth,
I can stand on my own.

Now I see the truth,
I was holding myself back,
thinking I needed someone,
but it was my own strength that I lacked.


Chorus:
I won't let anyone hold me back,
I am my own strength and I won't crack,
my truth is my power,
it's what I lack.
I don't need anyone's validation,
my strength is my salvation,
I'll stand tall and proud,
my inner fire blazing

I am the one who's left standing,
triumphant and free,
my own hero,
that's all I'll ever need.

and now I'm standing tall,
it's my choice
I'm unstoppable

I won't let anyone hold me back,
I am my own strength and I won't crack,
my truth is my power,
it's what I lack.
I don't need anyone's validation,
my strength is my salvation,
I'll stand tall and proud,
my inner fire blazing


Outro:
I am the one who's left standing,
my own hero,
that's all
