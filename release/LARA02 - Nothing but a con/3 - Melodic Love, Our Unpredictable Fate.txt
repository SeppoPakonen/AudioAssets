Verse 1:
Didn't see it coming, but you hit me like a ton of bricks,
now I can't imagine life without your loving and your tricks.
Never believed in love at first sight,
but with you, it just felt so right.
Lost in your mesmerizing gaze,
I knew I had found my soulmate,
You showed me that destiny is real,
and in your arms, I finally feel

Chorus:
I never knew I needed this love, but now I can't imagine living without it,
you're my everything and I'll never doubt it.
With you, I've found a love that makes everything else fade,
and I never want to let it slip away.

Verse 2:
Every time our lips meet,
it's like a perfect symphony,
Every moment with you feels like a dream come true,
I never thought I'd find someone like you.
We found a love that was real and pure,
something we never could've seen before.
Fate brought us together, despite the odds,
like we were written in the stars above.

Chorus:
I never knew I needed this love, but now I can't imagine living without it,
you're my everything and I'll never doubt it.
With you, I've found a love that makes everything else fade,
and I never want to let it slip away.

Bridge:
Lost in the chaos of life, I never thought I'd find
someone who made everything feel right.
But here we are, in each other's arms,
our love blazing brighter than a shooting star.
Lost in your love, I've found myself,
all my fears and doubts, vanished into thin air.

Chorus:
I never knew I needed this love, but now I can't imagine living without it,
you're my everything and I'll never doubt it.
With you, I've found a love that makes everything else fade,
and I never want to let it slip away.
