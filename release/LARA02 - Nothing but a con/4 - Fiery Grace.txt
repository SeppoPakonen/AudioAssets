Intro:
Our eyes locked, bodies close, it's like we're in a trance,
new sensations, we can't resist, we take a chance.

Verse 1:
Whispers in my ear, a devilish delight, swear I've never felt this alive,
on this hot summer night.
Your fingers tracing down my spine, sending shivers through my core,
lost in this moment, I can't help but want more.
Every touch, every kiss, a fire ignites,
consuming us in its bliss.
You take my breath away, with every touch, every kiss,
it's like a spell you cast, I can't resist.

Pre-Chorus 1:
Our bodies fuel the desire, as our passion grows higher,
we can't deny this burning fire.

Chorus 1:
Our bodies in perfect sync, emotions running wild,
this feeling, it's pure magic, we can't deny.
Our chemistry ignites, setting our souls on fire,
in this moment, everything else fades into desire.

Verse 2:
As the moon rises high, we're lost in each other's gaze,
our bodies entwined, in a passionate craze.
As the morning light creeps in, we're still tangled in the sheets,
our desire still burning, we can't deny this heat.
In the aftermath, we lay intertwined, our hearts and souls connected,
our bodies defined.
Underneath the stars, we surrender to our lust,
our bodies moving in perfect rhythm, we trust.

Pre-Chorus 2:
Lost in the moment, we're caught in a daze,
every touch, every whisper, a love we can't erase.

Chorus 1:
Our bodies in perfect sync, emotions running wild,
this feeling, it's pure magic, we can't deny.
Our chemistry ignites, setting our souls on fire,
in this moment, everything else fades into desire.






Chorus 2:
Lost in this moment, we're caught in a daze,
but I'll follow you anywhere, just lead the way.
Lost in this moment, we're caught in a daze,
but I'll follow you anywhere, just lead the way.
Every touch, every kiss, a love like ours is rare,
our bodies in perfect harmony, nothing can compare.

Bridge:
As the sun rises, we'll lay here in each other's embrace,
our love radiating with a fiery grace.
As the sun rises, we'll lay here in each other's embrace, our love radiating with a fiery grace. You devour me,
like an apple pie so sweet, and we have a very merry time when we meet.

Outro:
As the sun rises, we'll lay here in each other's embrace, our love radiating with a fiery grace. You devour me, like an apple pie so sweet,
and we have a very merry time when we meet. But as the night fades, we know our love will never retreat.
