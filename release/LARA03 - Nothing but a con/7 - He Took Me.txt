We want alcohol, so you know it's getting closer
sisterhood, gotta be a joker
He swag, I feel his nuts
We go somewhere, couldn't never get enough
I leave him with a dream of a different breed
He coming, that's a momentary bliss
I may not know, he gives no indication
He can laugh a spineless laugh
on and on, for generations

He took me, he gon' think that I invented sex.
That when he said lately he been obsessed
rolling through them street, and love is all we need.
Hesitate, but still going down with disease.

What is it you want me to tell you?
Check this out, babe, that you're not afraid to
put it in me, get the night through.
This ain't first time I fuck with a dude.
The story of us gets my heartbeat racing,
asking him does he need it, no matter what we're facing.
Defining life by this, love is forever.
My drive won't break, you just did me a favor.

He took me, he gon' think that I invented sex...

Stay away, don't cause any more damage.
This hood life that we're living is so savage.
They say that I'm wrong, but you can't realize,
until you're breaking, facing suicide.
You know my weakness, you know my heart,
You could take me now, don't pull me apart.
Your movements, I love the way you do it.
You find me going on, I won't ever quit.

Oh, come on, babe, oh, yeah, oh oh, you find me going on, I won't ever quit.

He took me, he gon' think that I invented sex...
He took me, he gon' think that I invented sex...
