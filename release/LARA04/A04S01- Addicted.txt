[Verse 1]
All we wanna do is let loose up in the club
Dancing with our friends, ain't no need to be too tough
It's just me and you, let's make magic in the sheets
Come get a taste, let's fulfill all our freaky needs

[Chorus]
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted

[Verse 2]
You want it, you desire it, don't you dare deny it
So hit my phone, fulfill my needs, let's ignite it
You only got one chance to make things right
So reach out and grab what you want tonight

[Chorus]
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted

[Verse 3]
Keep it coming,  don't let me come down
This party ain't over, 'til we're both in the ground
Your body got me yearning for a taste of you
But fulfilling each other's desires, that's what we gotta do

[Chorus]
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted

[Bridge]
I knew you were trouble, but I couldn't resist
In the midst of chaos, you turned out to be a bliss
Push and pull, we dance in this game
Lost in desire, our love's never tame

[Chorus]
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted
Just one night, no need for commitment
But damn, your touch has got me addicted



I knew you were trouble
chaos and struggle
but I couldn't resist
and you turned out   to be a bliss
