[Verse 1]
Thought I had it all figured out, thought I was fine
Then you came along, girl, now I'm walkin' a thin line.
Got my mind on my money, ain't got room for distraction
Can't change my mind, my path is set with no retraction.
We don't need no drinks, we don't need no drugs
Just us two, and it's a whole lotta love.
And then she showed me just how it's done
Freak in the sheets, but she's my number one
Lost in you, love was blind, so I had to find
My way back, now I'm back in control of my grind
Tryna act hard, but we know you're soft inside
All that tough talk, baby just let it slide
Got stacks of cash, hustle fills up our cup
In this game of life, we never give two fucks
Come on get it baby, you know just what to do
Show me how you work it, let me see that voodoo

[Chorus]
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Ain't no doubt, gonna love again tonight
Lights low, clothes on the floor
We don't care, we always want more

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night

[Verse 2]
Drunk in love, we dance, drink, and explore
New beginning, new heights, we can't ignore
Whisper dirty words, I'll make sure they come true
We'll change the sheets again, round two just for you
Settin' fire to the past, no lookin' back
Gonna make my own way, ain't no one holdin' me back
You know it's time to let go, gotta see it all
Ain't no stopping this ride, we unstoppable
You been so naughty with your knickers dropping down
A little more time and you'll have me on the ground
I'm feeling you, and I know you been feeling me
Let's hit the road, and wild out like it's meant to be.
Wanna taste the poison, but I won't give in
Bad bitches wanna fuck, but I won't let them win
Fuck buddies turned lovers, now we tangled in the web
No more hiding, we ownin' this shit, no need for a safe word

[Chorus]
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Ain't no doubt, gonna love again tonight
Lights low, clothes on the floor
We don't care, we always want more

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night

[Chorus]
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Ain't no doubt, gonna love again tonight
Lights low, clothes on the floor
We don't care, we always want more

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night

[Bridge]
The scent of apples fills the air, she's like a forbidden fruit
But I won't take a bite, I know she's just out to loot
Thought I had you, but you always switchin' lanes
Ain't no time for games, gotta make that bankroll gains
I can't keep my eyes off you, it's becoming obscene
And then you drop the bomb, you're seeing someone else, it seems
Talk shit all you want, but the truth is I'm winning
So keep hating, while I'm out here grinning

[Chorus]
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Ain't no doubt, gonna love again tonight
Lights low, clothes on the floor
We don't care, we always want more

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night

[Chorus]
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Ain't no doubt, gonna love again tonight
Lights low, clothes on the floor
We don't care, we always want more

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night
Gonna wild out on a Friday night

Come on get it baby, you know just what to do

[Chorus 1]
Everybody talkin', thinkin' they got me figured
But then you come in, see the real me, and you deliver
Freak in the sheets, we know how to break free
Ain't no one else I'd rather be wild with, that's the key

Gonna wild out on a Friday night
