[Verse 1]
Money, fame, and power, that's what they all chase
But I got my love, and that's my saving grace
He tried to buy me a drink, but I said no
I'm here for the party, gonna let it all go
From the streets to the mic, I'm takin' control
Carefree and strong, I'll rock and roll
On the rooftop, we be high up above
Dancin' to the beat, feeling nothing but love
You know I gotchu boo, and we winning right now
Like two bosses, we rollin' with our crowns high
Through thick and thin, we gon' stay true
Everybody one for all, just like we do
Got my eyes on the prize, living like a queen
Can't nobody stop me, I'm livin' the dream
Travelin' through life, ain't no end in sight
Time keep tickin', but we gon' make the most of this ride

[Chorus]
You and me, all night long
Show me what you got, don't do me wrong
Slick like ice, but you heat me up quick
Need to cool down, but I just can't quit.
Risk it all for love, no holding back
Can't deny the fact, we're on the right track
I'll give you all, no need to beg
But if you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge

[Verse 2]
I grind all day, never gonna take a break
But I'm blessed with success, so haters can't relate
We be living in this world so damn beautiful
Like me and my girl, we be so suitable
We turnt up in this club, you know what I mean
Hands on me, lips on me, it's a scene
Haters talkin', but we marchin' strong
Cocky confidence, we gon' prove 'em wrong
City nights, car rides, and your arm around me
In this moment, I feel whole, feelin' blessed and lucky
Ridin' through the lights, feelin' so alive
You show me how to love, now I'm ready to thrive
From the city to the suburbs, we be wildin' out all night
You can't resist my charm, you know my time is coming, right?
You know what you worth, ain't gotta prove a thing
If you want a meet, know I'll treat you like a king

[Chorus]
You and me, all night long
Show me what you got, don't do me wrong
Slick like ice, but you heat me up quick
Need to cool down, but I just can't quit.
Risk it all for love, no holding back
Can't deny the fact, we're on the right track
I'll give you all, no need to beg
But if you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge

If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge

[Bridge]
I know my worth, won't settle for less
Ain't no man gonna make me second guess
They say opposites attract, we the perfect match
Your badass attitude, got me falling fast
Tattoo my name, all over your skin
Ain't no doubt, that you're my ride or die kin.
We be wildin' out, getting nasty, grinding all night
In our own world, we rule, nothing but pure delight

[Chorus]
You and me, all night long
Show me what you got, don't do me wrong
Slick like ice, but you heat me up quick
Need to cool down, but I just can't quit.
Risk it all for love, no holding back
Can't deny the fact, we're on the right track
I'll give you all, no need to beg
But if you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge

If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
If you cross me, feel my stiletto's edge
