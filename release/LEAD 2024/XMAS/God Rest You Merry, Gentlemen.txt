[Verse 1]
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone astray

[Refrain]
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 2]
In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn

[Refrain]
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 3]
Fear not then, said the Angel
Let nothing you affright
This day is born a Savior
Of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's pow'r and might

[Refrain]
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 4]
The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find

[Refrain]
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 5]
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down
Unto the Lord did pray

[Refrain]
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
