[Verse 1]
Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and Heaven and nature sing

[Chorus]
We will sing, sing, sing
Joy to the world
We will sing, sing, sing

[Verse 2]
Joy to the world the savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

[Chorus]
We will sing, sing, sing
Joy to the world
We will sing, sing, sing

[Verse 3]
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

[Chorus]
Joy to the world
We will sing, sing, sing

[Outro]
Joyful, joyful we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
And hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above

Joyful, joyful we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
And hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above
