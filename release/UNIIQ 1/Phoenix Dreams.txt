(splice effects)
Yeah, bi bi getting hold of ya
Yeah, bi bi getting hold of ya
I am ga, bi getting hold of ya
I save shots for my bitch



Verse 1:
I refuse to be held down, gonna rise up like a phoenix from the ashes,
my dreams are too big,
ain't no time for excuses and clashes.

I take a hit, let my mind soar, forgetting the bullshit, can't hold us no more,

and we keep dancing, like we're on cloud nine, just living for the moment, this feeling so divine.

I keep chasing this dream , like it's my only source of light,
times get tough, but I never lose sight,
got a fire inside, burning bright like a flame,
no limits, no boundaries, I'll do it all in my name.

Chorus 1:
Riding high, a king on my throne, taking control,
breaking free from the unknown.
Feeling so alive, no fear, just pure adrenaline

Verse 2:
Lost in the city lights, but I'll find my way, living in the fast lane,

I'll embrace the chaos each day.

Lost in this world, but I'll find my way,
living in the fast lane,
I'll embrace the chaos each day.

Lost in this world, but I'll find my way,
chasing my dreams,
won't let them fade away.

Lost in this world, but I'll keep moving,
with my head held high, my strength unproving.

Lost in this world, but I'll keep pushing on,
we don't need no limitations, we'll be blazing our own path,

no boundaries, just pure imagination.

Chorus 1:
Riding high,  a king on my throne, taking control,
breaking free from the unknown.
Feeling so alive, no fear, just pure adrenaline

Bridge:
Lost in this world, but I'll find my way, guided by the music,
every note leading me astray.

Lost in this world, but I'll find my way, 
guided by the music,

every note leading me astray,

no matter where I go or what I do,
it's clear to see,
there's a higher purpose in every tune.

Pre-Chorus 2:
But in this moment, I'm feeling so free,
like nothing can stop me,

I'll be chasing my dreams endlessly.

Chorus 1:
Riding high, a king on my throne, taking control,
breaking free from the unknown.
Feeling so alive, no fear, just pure adrenaline

High, a king on my throne, taking control,
breaking free from the unknown.
Feeling so alive, no fear, just pure adrenaline

Outro:
Lost in this world, but I'll find my way, guided by the music,

every note leading me astray.
Lost in this world, but I'll find my way, 
guided by the music
