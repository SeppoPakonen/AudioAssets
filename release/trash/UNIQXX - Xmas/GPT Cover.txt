Song 1: Wonderful Christmas Peace

I wake up to the same reality
darkness on the ground shamefully
where is the snow when it should be
covering the ground
	 
People rushing round busily
buying everything thruthfully
everyone seeks a way to live
and soon the time will come

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace

Children are anxiously waiting
what if Santa brings them nothing
mothers and fathers have warned
not to be mean

when they get older, understanding
they should remain loving
the whole world could be much better
if Santa was real

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace

Come and let your worries fall behind
relax and have a really calmful mind

Snow is silently falling
mind is calmly healing
people are slowly waking
to wonderful Christmas peace
