	"biography": "PMS is a rap band founded by high school friends from Oulu, Finland. Its original style was love songs. It tried to make catchy music but failed. Quarrelsome breakup songs have also been very popular. The chorus is often sung by a woman and the verse is sung by a man. The band initially had 3 members, but 2 left, and the last member is making new songs with guest singers. The place is always open for new members, but there were no takers.\r\n\r\nThe band has been making music on an amateur level for a very long time. The band decided to release their music commercially only in 2023, 16 years after they started.",
