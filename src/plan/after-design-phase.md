# What Happens After the Design Phase?

## Overview
After completing the design phase, the project moves into the implementation phase where the planned components are built according to the specifications developed during the design phase.

## Implementation Phase
During this phase, developers will:
1. Set up the development environment based on the project setup plan
2. Implement the rhyming engine with all the designed algorithms
3. Build the data management layer according to the data models
4. Create the CLI interface following the design specifications
5. Implement the project manager for JSON file handling
6. Develop the alternative manager for handling multiple line options
7. Integrate all components together

## Testing Phase
Following implementation, the testing phase ensures:
1. All components work correctly individually (unit testing)
2. Components work together properly (integration testing)
3. The application meets all functional requirements (functional testing)
4. Performance meets expectations (performance testing)

## Deployment Phase
Finally, the deployment phase involves:
1. Packaging the application for distribution
2. Distributing it through appropriate channels
3. Creating documentation for users and developers
4. Setting up maintenance processes for ongoing support

## Transition Activities
- Code reviews of the implementation
- Verification that implementation matches design specifications
- Preparation of development environment for implementation team
- Assignment of tasks to development team members
