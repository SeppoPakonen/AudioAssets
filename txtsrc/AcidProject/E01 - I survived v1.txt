Intro:
My town
A Smile town
Where everyone
Just fights

Verse 1:
I'll meet Jim
You know him
. . 
just cheats .. .... ..
He smiled while injecting me the dream
while the police took me in
while they bribed a witness
with a lawyer death kiss

Chorus:
I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
but I stayed alive
and I finally got free

Verse 2:
Friday night
streets
Someone comes
Tries to
They all try to make me look bad
How one can
when you

Chorus:
I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
but I stayed alive
and I finally got free

Bridge:
Twisted men all over the world

Disgusting 

Butt clan
The worst nightmare of a straight man
Even thought he's on teevee
he prayed on me, he's nothing like I've ever seen

We won't miss you
We never missed you
who's just a bad boy in rotten sense
Just a cheater, a weaker's beater
...
Nobody misses you
...
Rich bastard ....
a bad man, just lock him up

Chorus:
I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
but I stayed alive
and I finally got free

Outro:
Who will help, and who will care?
Who will notice my quiet prayers?
Who has the will? And the skill?
Smile in jail you scum
..., succumb
