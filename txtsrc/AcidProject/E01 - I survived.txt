Intro:
My town
where everyone just smiles
despite all the fights and arguing

Verse 1:
I'll meet the old backstabber again
I would stab him if it was legal
That woman, my neighbour, just cheats her husband
ant the mayor stole the tax money
The doctor smiled while injecting the poison
The police took the bribe money
and did put an innocent man to jail
and the lawyer signed the framing

Chorus:
I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
but I survived
for now

Verse 2:
Friday night, streets of the small town
Someone comes to me, smiling
He tries to stab me
I guess it's A normal day
Everyone tries to make me look bad
How one can survive
when you have to fear for your life
while buing groceries

Chorus:

Bridge:
The most twisted man in the world
A 
Disgusting
<a sexual predator>

The worst nightmare of a heterosexual man
Even though he is a star on the tv
How you can take this? Where's the justice?
What can happen?

I won't be missing you
I never missed you
You were just a cheater
I had to be on the same planet with.

Nobody misses him
Nobody will miss him
Rich bastard, a bad man, corrupted
Who deserves to be in prison

Chorus:


Outro:
Who helps, who cares?
Who notices when nothing makes sense?
Who has the skill to do anything?
While everyone is still smiling
Smile in peace
Smile in peace, you bastard
Smile in peace, with a knife in your back
