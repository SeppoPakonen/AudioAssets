Title: Smile town

Intro:
My town
A smile town
Where everyone
Just fights

Verse 1:
You know me
Easy as can be
I met a guy
Business-wise, daytime
He smiled while injecting me the dream
while the police took me in
while they bribed a witness
with a lawyer death kiss

Chorus:
Yeah I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Verse 2:
--Friday night
--Street's a sight
--Someone came
--Pulls out a gun, I shoot and he succumbs
They tried to make me look bad
And put me in a body bag
Must be something I know
Don't know what though

Chorus:
So I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Bridge:
From backstabbing smiles,
From the knives in the fights
From the lies of a little town
Lives with a little matter
From the pain behind happy smiles
That goes on forever
For crazy guy, now rules apply
Good that he ain't that clever

Drink laced 
The worst nightmare of a shitfaced
Even thought he's on teevee
he prayed on me, he's nothing like I've ever seen

Was violating
Couldn't stop him
So disgraced
Couldn't feel a thing
I saw his grin,
Couldn't move a limb,
People were watching,
But nobody would stop him
Nobody wouldstop him
Why nobody would stop him?
Why nobody would stop him?

Chorus:
So I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Outro:
--Who will help, and who will care?
--Who will notice my quiet prayers?
--Who has the will
--And the skill?
Smile in jail you scum
In a little cell
Smile in jail you scum
Burn in hell
