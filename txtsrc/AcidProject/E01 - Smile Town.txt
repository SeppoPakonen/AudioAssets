Title: Smile town

Intro:
My town
A smile town
Where everyone
Just fights

Verse 1:
You know me
Simple as can be
I'll meet a guy
Business-wise, daytime
He smiled while injecting me the dream
while the police took me in
while they bribed a witness
with a lawyer death kiss

Chorus:
Yeah I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Verse 2:
Friday night
Street's a sight
Someone comes
Pulls out a gun, I shoot and he succumbs
They try to make me look bad
And put me in a body bag
Must be something I know
Don't know what though

Chorus:
So I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Bridge:
From backstabbing smiles,
And the knives in the fights
And the lies of a little town
Lives with a little matter
The pain behind happy smiles
That goes on forever
For crazy guy now rules apply
Good that he ain't that clever

Drink laced 
The worst nightmare of a shitfaced
Even thought he's on teevee
he prayed on me, he's nothing like I've ever seen

Was violating
Couldn't stop him
So disgraced
Can't feel a thing
I see his grin,
Can't move a limb,
People are watching,
But nobody will stop him
Nobody will stop him
Nobody will stop him
Why nobody won't stop him?

Chorus:
So I, I did not get what I want
I did not get what I need
But I stayed alive
Finally I got free

Outro:
Who will help, and who will care?
Who will notice my quiet prayers?
Who has the will
And the skill?
Smile in jail you scum
In a little cell
Smile in jail you scum
Burn in hell
