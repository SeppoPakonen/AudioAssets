Let's make a song for a cheerleading team dance, which can be no longer than 1min 30sec.

The lyrics of the song are:
Verse 1:
I have loved you a thousand years
I'll see a love you feel
I'll do anything for you
But you don't seem to notice
Do you think of me every day
When you walked away
Was I only fool for your loving

Chorus:
Now watch when I walk away
'Cos my heartache won't go away
I'll do anything for you
But you don't care about it
Are you afraid of love
Why can't you see what's above
I'll do anything for you
But you don't care about it

Here’s a sample “style” prompt you can feed into Suno to get a 1:30-long cheer-team backing track that fits your lyrics:

“Genre: High-energy Dance-Pop with stadium-rock and marching-band influences
Tempo: 135–145 BPM
Instrumentation:
• Driving electronic drums with cheer-style snare & hand-claps
• Punchy synth bass
• Bright synth stabs & arpeggios
• Layered electric guitar power-chords
• Triumphant brass hits (trumpets/horns) for accent
• Optional crowd-chant ambience
Mood & Structure:
• Uplifting, empowering, anthem-style
• Intro (8 bars) with drum roll → Verse → Pre-chorus build (drum fill) → Chorus “drop” → Verse 2 → Chorus → Outro
• Emphasize big builds into each chorus, strong downbeats on 1 & 3 for cheer sync
Length: 1 min 30 sec, structure timed for two verses + two choruses.”

Feel free to tweak BPM or swap in more EDM synths vs. live drums depending on the “feel” you want.

Nice. What about more EDM style?

<<<<
Here’s a Suno‐ready “EDM style” prompt tailored for a 1:30 cheer-team backing track:

Genre: Big-Room/Festival EDM with pop-cheer energy
Tempo: 128–132 BPM
Key: A Minor (for bright yet driving feel)

Instrumentation:
• Four-on-the-floor kick with tight transient & sidechain pump
• Snappy claps + layered cheer-style snare rolls
• Subby, punchy bassline
• Supersaw lead synths for hooks and stabs
• Pluck arpeggios (short, perky) under verse sections
• Wide, gated pad for verse atmosphere
• Big risers, white-noise sweeps & impacts for builds
• Vocal‐chop accents (e.g. “Hey! Hey!”) for crowd-chant feel
• Optional stadium crowd ambi-pad or low chant under drops

Mood & Energy:
• Uplifting, anthemic, festival-size drops that hit like a “cheer stunt”
• Tension‐builders before chorus (“drop”) with snare‐rolls & risers
• Hard-hitting four-on-the-floor choruses to sync with pom-poms

Structure (1:30 total):
Intro (8 bars): filtered kick + pad →
Verse 1 (16 bars): plucks, bass, vocal chops under lyrics →
Build 1 (8 bars): snare roll + riser →
Drop/Chorus 1 (16 bars): full supersaw lead, crowd-chant sub layer →
Verse 2 (8 bars): bring back plucks + chopped vocals →
Build 2 (8 bars): shorter, higher tension →
Drop/Chorus 2 (16 bars): biggest impact, double supersaw layer →
Outro (8 bars): kick-out with fade of synth chord/stadium chant

Length: exactly ~1′30″—two build→drop cycles, two verses, compact intro/outro.

Ok. This doesn't seem to combine well singing with the rest of the song.
Please try some jazzy style, but with dance beat.

Here’s a Suno-ready style prompt for a jazzy-dance backing track (1:30 total), designed to sit under your vocals and keep the energy high for a cheer routine:

Genre: Jazz-House / Nu-Jazz with Dance-Funk groove
Tempo: 122–126 BPM (slightly swung 4/4 feel)
Key: C Major (bright, easy for vocals)

Instrumentation & Texture
• Hybrid Drum Kit: four-on-the-floor kick + swung hi-hat pattern + tight snare/claps
• Electric Upright Bass: walking/funk line locked to kick, adds warmth
• Electric Piano (Rhodes): extended jazz chords (7ths, 9ths) comping on off-beats
• Clean Electric Guitar: muted “chunk” comp in verses, wah-enhanced funk in choruses
• Brass Section: punchy trumpet & trombone stabs on 2 & 4, brief trombone slides for accents
• Synth Bass Layer: subby low end under choruses for extra punch
• Light Strings Pad: sustained under choruses for lift
• Percussion Accents: shaker, congas, cowbell for groove
• Crowd-chant FX: subtle “hey!” or “woo!” chops in build-ups

Arrangement (1:30)
Intro (8 bars): Rhodes vamp + upright bass groove, soft ride cymbal →
Verse 1 (16 bars): drop guitar & brass; keep drums & Rhodes; leave space for vocal →
Pre-Chorus (8 bars): add congas + shaker; horn stabs build; snare rolls on last 2 bars →
Chorus 1 (16 bars): full band—drum four-on-floor, synth bass, strings pad, guitar funk; brass hits mark each four bars →
Verse 2 (8 bars): strip back to drums, electric piano, upright bass; vocal-centric →
Pre-Chorus 2 (8 bars): same as first but add rising white-noise sweep →
Chorus 2 (16 bars): biggest, with crowd-chant synth chops and double-tracked horns →
Outro (8 bars): fade out guitar rhythm + Rhodes comp + soft brass pad

Mood & Dynamics
• Verses: intimate jazz-club vibe under vocals, lower energy
• Build-ups: steadily layer percussion & horns to create anticipation
• Choruses: dance-floor punch, bright chords, driving low end—perfect for pom-pom hits or stunts
• Keep synth bass subtle in verses so vocals shine, bring it up in choruses for the “drop” feel

Length: ~1 min 30 sec, two verses, two choruses, concise intro/outro.
