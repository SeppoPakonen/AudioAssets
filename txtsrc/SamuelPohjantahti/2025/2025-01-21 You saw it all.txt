Title: You saw it all

I used to dream of a life with you
now I'm awake, and it's all I can do
Money calling, hard to ignore
Guns blazing, blood on the floor, yeah
Holy shit, I feel high and you suckers
wanna take a bite.
Can't trust no one, I'm all alone
Trouble follows, can't find my throne

Riding high, but it won't last long
When I see you, I know I'm wrong
You saw it all

Hold me close, make me complete
You smell so sweet, like summer heat
Am I a fool, for your game?
Who's the boss, who's to blame?
Riding high, but it won't last long
When I see you, I know I'm wrong
You saw it all, this love we lacked ain't no good,
but no turning back

Riding high, but it won't last long
When I see you, I know I'm wrong
You saw it all, this love we lacked
ain't no good, but no turning back
