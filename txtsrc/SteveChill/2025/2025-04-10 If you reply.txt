Verse 1:
Youth is gone
Guess you have moved on
I'd love to meet, I'd like to see
Your smile so sweet
Will we ever be the same?
What we became?
Why is the life a game
of money and fame?
I message you hey

Chorus:
If you reply, with me in mind
Will you tell me that we should intertwine?
Will you tell me how you want me back?
Will you tell me that?

Was it all by chance?
Will we have romance?
Tonight makes me long for 
our dance.

Your touch, (oh) so divine
(These) memories trap me inside
Lost in echoes of your name
Hoping you feel the same

Will we find a way anew?
Under (the) stars, just us two
Wishing we could turn back time
Rewrite the story, you and I

Bridge:
Will you tell?
Will you tell?
Will you tell me how much you want me back now?
Can we write a better story for our glory?

Chorus:

Outro:
If you reply, with me in mind
Will you tell me that we should intertwine?
Will you tell me how you want me back?
Will you tell me that?
