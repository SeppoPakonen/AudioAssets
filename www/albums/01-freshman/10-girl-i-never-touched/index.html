<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This song is actually just a technical exercise, and the exercise is in the "Gtr Cl" channel :)</p>
<p>This is the very first thing what I learned to play with a guitar (by my own choice). I decided to find the notes that I wrote to the sequencer's piano roll and play that with the guitar. I couldn't even change the chord between C and Am, so I had to record both chords separately. After this, I decided to practice the changing of the chords, so I played "Outkast - Hey ya" chords for like 6 hours straight, until it finally was kind of fluent. I trained more that song following days.</p>
<p>Refurbished from the simple exercise: 22.8.2022 This was made to a differen composition in 2006, but I didn't want to reuse it here, so I added some appropriate themes based on the original themes.</p>

<h2>Lyrics (EN)</h2>
<pre class="card"><code>[Intro]
I pulled you to the right direction
But no-one pulled me
[Verse 1]
Girl, I am gambling with you
I should have known it too
&#x27;Cos suffering ain&#x27;t defending
One could have seen through this
We were a bad investment
I wasn&#x27;t getting cared
All that talking over me
Is worst red flag that I can see
[Prechorus 1]
My attention is stolen
And I can&#x27;t get time returned
Fuck your whole world
[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that&#x27;s good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had
[Verse 2]
what I could take on the edge
Working for both our sakes
I held on the promises
While you were with someone else
Now every midnight
Memory plays on broken frames
of your secret smile, your stolen games
[Prechorus 2]
Yeah, I’ve got to face the loss
Let these shattered pieces fall
I am so done
[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that&#x27;s good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had
[Chorus]
I missed everything that is fun
Everything that&#x27;s good
Now injustice prevails
When I watch young dudes
All the pain got me stuck
Almost like it was planned
I just want to be loved
By the girl I never had
[Outro]
By the girl I never had
By the girl I never had
By the girl I never had</code></pre>
<h2>Lyrics (EN alt — 2025 teen slang rewrite)</h2>
<pre class="card"><code>[Verse 1]
Girl, I’m riskin’ chips on you
Knew the glitch, but rode it too
‘Cause vibin’ ain’t survivin’, nah
Your mask was see-through, flaw
Bad stock, I lost my stash
Never got no love, just crash
All that talkin’ over me
Biggest red flag I can see
[Prechorus 1]
My focus got jacked quick
Time don’t bounce, it don’t click
Almost wreck your whole clique
[Chorus]
Missed out on every lit run
Every vibe that’s good
Now the system feels rigged
When I peep young hoods
All this hurt got me glitched
Almost like it was pitched
I just crave bein’ loved
By the girl I never touched
[Verse 2]
Walkin’ edge for both our names
Held the bag, you played new games
Kept your lies as promises
While you flexed with someone else
Now each late-night spin
Replays reels of secret sins
Of your sly half-smile, your stolen wins
[Prechorus 2]
Yeah, I face what’s gone raw
Let these shattered pixels fall
I am so done, no more
[Chorus]
Missed out on every lit run
Every vibe that’s good
Now the system feels rigged
When I peep young hoods
All this hurt got me glitched
Almost like it was pitched
I just crave bein’ loved
By the girl I never touched
[Chorus]
Missed out on every lit run
Every vibe that’s good
Now the system feels rigged
When I peep young hoods
All this hurt got me glitched
Almost like it was pitched
I just crave bein’ loved
By the girl I never touched

By the girl I never touched
By the girl I never touched
