Album number 1. Years 2001-2004.

Scope
- Early works (circa 2001–2004) with 2020-2025 curation. Album 01 is published in both FI and EN; treat lyrics as final (not drafts).

Content Notes (from .txt)
- Themes: self-belief against odds (e.g., Yksi Neljästä / One out of four), competition and grit (To Victory or Ruin), adolescent longing, social friction, and boundary-setting (You’re Just Awful).
- Style: FI primary with published EN translations; clear verse/chorus structures; rhythmic hooks and motivational refrains.
- Archives: `ENG Archive.txt` and `FIN Archive.txt` outline background, ISRC/IPI, and production history (DAWs from 2001–2005; later remixes; FI-first authorship).

Psychological Notes (light)
- Identity formation and agency: frequent assertions of capability, resilience, and moving past peer negativity.
- Attachment + boundaries: early experiences of crushes and mismatched dynamics; emerging skill at saying “no”.
- Affect range: optimism and perseverance alongside frustration/anger; catharsis via energetic choruses.

Conventions
- Convert lyric `.txt` → structured `.md` modeled after `06 Prom/Love is my song.md` (Inspiration, Structure, Lyrics FI/EN with syllables, Notes).
- Keep bilingual pairs in sync; prefer FI as canonical text; for 01 (published FI+EN), do not label EN as a draft; note AI assistance only if relevant.
- Do not rename album/year folders; when renaming `.tg`, update the package `.upp` file list.
- In the `.upp`, list `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first if a file section exists.

Next Actions
- Prioritize `.md` conversion for tracks with both FI and EN already in one file (low-friction wins).
- For any missing side (FI/EN), backfill from the published release source; avoid “draft” labels for 01.
- Add cover image asset (stable filename) next to the package when ready.
