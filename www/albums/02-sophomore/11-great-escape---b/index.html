<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We played this song with the band called The Vice. I played my first gig with that band in spring 2006. This song was played in that gig. The gig was in the centre of the Oulu in a old wooden building next to the movie theather.</p>
<p>The original lyrics were not great. They were in non-fluent English. I also tried to please others with them, so they were a double-failure. They weren&#x27;t to my own taste.</p>
<p>Hindsight 2005 this had way too artsy intro, and the effort to please others instead ourselves was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>The most positive thing in this song is the fact, that my 2nd band &quot;worked&quot; and &quot;we shipped the product in time&quot; in the sense, that we practiced this song for the first gig and we played the gig. That was a very solid run for a couple of teenagers, where no-one had any knowledge of managing that kind of process, and where no-one had prior experience of performing with a band.</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>A rock song with a melancholic yet energetic feel, featuring a female vocalist, The song is in a minor key, likely A minor, and maintains a moderate tempo throughout, The instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums, The acoustic guitar provides a consistent arpeggiated chord progression, while the electric guitar offers melodic fills and a distorted solo, The bass guitar provides a solid rhythmic and harmonic foundation, The drums maintain a steady rock beat with occasional fills, The female vocals are clean and clear, with a slightly melancholic tone, Production elements include reverb on the vocals and guitars, giving the song a spacious feel, The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental break and a guitar solo</p>

[Instrumental]

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)



[Verse 1]

Once we had a night and we spent it together

Once we were friends, or I just thought so

And once you wanted me back at any price, yeah, at any price

You were like a cat with me, catching a fool

Caught me in a trap, but I didn&#x27;t want you

Please let me go now, we&#x27;ll meet then soon

I will give you a call, I will, believe me



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m planning my great escape, hiding all my traces

I have no reason here to stay

I&#x27;m planning my great escape, wanna get away

&#x27;Cause you make me feel this way



[Verse 2]

We&#x27;re eating a breakfast with you next to me

Why am I here when I don&#x27;t feel like it

I&#x27;m guilty in your prison, but walking free

Still locked to you

This mistake can&#x27;t stay with me &#x27;til end of my life

Hey, we have no more common than big need for love

Do you wanna go with me, go through it all

I&#x27;m sorry about that only for me



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m planning my great escape, hiding all my traces

I&#x27;ve no reason here to stay

I&#x27;m planning my great escape, wanna get away

&#x27;Cause you make me feel this way



[Instrumental]

(Hey, you should know that)

(I&#x27;ll take my stuff and go)

(Never coming back to home)

(Tomorrow I&#x27;ll be gone)



[Guitar Solo]



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m making my great escape, taking my own way

I&#x27;ve no reason there to stay

I&#x27;m making my great escape, hiding all my traces

And you made me feel this way

I&#x27;m making my great escape, taking my own way

I&#x27;ve no reason there to stay

I&#x27;m making my great escape, hiding all my traces

And you made me feel this way (ooh-ooh-ooh)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)



[Verse 1]

Had that one wild night, we crashed out together

Thought we were friends, or maybe I just was

And you wanted me back for any price, yeah, like any price, too

You played real sneaky with me, baiting a fool

Caught me in your trap, but I didn&#x27;t want you

Please let me dip now, we&#x27;ll link up soon

I will hit up your phone, I will, believe me



[Instrumental]



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m plotting my great escape, hiding all my traces

I got no reason here to stay

I&#x27;m plotting my great escape, wanna get away

&#x27;Cause you make me feel this way



[Verse 2]

We eating our breakfast with you next to me

Why am I here when I don&#x27;t vibe with it

I&#x27;m guilty in your prison, still walking free

Still chained to you

This big L can&#x27;t stay with me till end of my life

Hey, we share nothing more than a big need for love

Do you wanna roll with me, go through it all

I&#x27;m sorry that it&#x27;s really just for me



[Instrumental]



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m plotting my great escape, hiding all my traces

Got no reason here to stay

I&#x27;m plotting my great escape, wanna get away

&#x27;Cause you make me feel this way



[Instrumental]

(Hey, you should know fr)

(I&#x27;ll grab my stuff and go)

(Never coming back home, no)

(Tomorrow I&#x27;ll be gone)



[Guitar Solo]



[Chorus]

I&#x27;m making my great escape, taking my own lane

Got no reason there to stay

I&#x27;m making my great escape, hiding all my traces

And you made me feel this way

I&#x27;m making my great escape, taking my own lane

Got no reason there to stay

I&#x27;m making my great escape, hiding all my traces

And you made me feel this way (ooh-ooh-ooh)
