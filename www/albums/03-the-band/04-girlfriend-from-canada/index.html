## Background
This is one of those songs, which I hade to make to impress my band mates. I never liked this and now I hate it.

We played this with my band &quot;The Vice&quot; and also performed it at our first and only gig.


## Lyrics (Original, in Finnish album)
Title: Girlfriend from Canada
```
[Verse 1]
After summer, we saw him first time
He looked like making suicide
He told how everyone will hate him
He told how how he&#x27;s pet rat died
He felt to ground and pretended crying
Asked God why he&#x27;s girlfriend died
We heard that the girl was from Canada
They met in chat but she blocked him there
Hey, we know you act, we know you lie
We know that your girlfriend hasn&#x27;t ever died
Somewhere in the North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
After a year what he said was so true
All hated him but for reason
He always whined but never listened
He was violent and played a ninja but
Came a day when he wanted to change
Wanna have friends and be happy
One of the girls who was there at the first day
Shook her head and made clear to him that

[Chorus]
We know you act and we know you lie
We know that your girlfriend hasn&#x27;t ever died
Somewhere in the North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
After few year he really felt it
When taking risks wasn&#x27;t anymore fun
It&#x27;s so hard to be a boy friendly
When no one ever ever speak to him
He came to school and pulled out his gun
Killed himself in front of everyone
Now, the girl is on his fresh grave and her
Words can be heard in the air that

[Chorus]
We knew you act, And we knew you lie,
we know that your girlfriend hadn&#x27;t ever died
Somewhere in the fucking Canada
```


## Lyrics (EN)
Title: Girlfriend from Canada (Steve Chill remix)

```
[Verse 1]
After summer, we saw him day one
Looked like &#x27;bout to call it quits
He said that everyone gon&#x27; hate him
He said his lil&#x27; pet rat just died
He hit the ground and fake-cried so loud
Asked God why his girlfriend died
We heard the girl was, like, from Canada
Met in a chat, then she blocked him there
Yo, we know you act, we know you lie
We know your &quot;girlfriend&quot; never really died
Somewhere up in North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
After a year, what he said was so true
All hated him and for reason
He always whined and never listened
He got violent, played like a ninja, but
Then one day he said he&#x27;d really change
Wanted some friends and be happy
One of the girls that was there on the first day
Shook her head, made it clear to him that

[Chorus]
We know you cap and we know you lie
We know your &quot;girlfriend&quot; never ever died
Somewhere up in North Canada

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
After few years he really felt it
When risk-taking wasn&#x27;t fun anymore
It&#x27;s so hard to be a friendly boy
When no one ever ever spoke to him
He came to school and pulled out a gun
Killed himself in front of everyone
Now the girl&#x27;s out at his fresh grave and her
Words can be heard in the air that

[Chorus]
We knew you cap, yeah we knew you lie,
We knew your &quot;girlfriend&quot; had not ever died
Somewhere in the freaking Canada
