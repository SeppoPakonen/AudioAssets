<h2>Lyrics (FI)</h2>
<p>Title: Viestin sulle tuon</p>
<pre class="card"><code>[Verse 1]
Ratsuilla joukko nyt kuolemaa tuo
Miekoilla lyö sua jos näkee nuo
Polttaa ne kirjat ja nimeää maat
Nuoret ei vanhaa muistaa saa
Pappi ja kirjuri toteuttavat
Käskyä muokata ajatuksia
Ollut ei kapinalla juuriakaan
Mut papereil tuhansii vuosia
[Prechorus 1]
Lapsi opi uusi kielikin
Joka just keksittiin
[Chorus]
Kuule kun kaukaa mä viestin sulle tuon
Valhetta onkin meil kaikki jutut nuo
Ne väärentää vanhoja papereita arkoja
Ja korruptoi historiaa
 
[Verse 2]
Hallinta mielen ei helppoa oo
Pienikin särö voi sen rikkoo
Sankari auttaa mut vihaseks saa
Vauvasta asti kun valehellaan
Tarkasti vannottu illuusio,
Pilkataan uutis-sensaatiol
Aseena puute ja inflaatio
Kateus kuin kastraatio
[Prechorus 1]
Riita jota turhempaa ei oo
Kerjää huomioo
[Chorus]
Kuule kun kaukaa mä viestin sulle tuon
Valhetta onkin meil kaikki jutut nuo
Ne väärentää vanhoja papereita arkoja
Ja korruptoi historiaa
[Chorus, chanting]
(oo-o-o-oo)

Kuule kun kaukaa mä viestin sulle tuon

<h2>Lyrics (EN)</h2>
<p>Title: I Bear Thee a Message</p>
<pre class="card"><code>[Verse 1]
Riding grim riders now bring doom and death,
Blades shall they beat thee if thou draw’st breath;
Books do they burn and baptize all lands,
Ban they the bygone from young hearts and hands;
Priest and the penman perform the decree,
Mould they men’s meanings as bidden to be;
Rebels have root there but scant to be found,
Yet parchments proclaim it for thousands around.
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Child, cherish a changeling tongue, learn it soon—
Coined but this forenoon.
[Chorus]
Hear, from afar, I a message thee bring;
False are the fables we fondly do sing;
Foully they forge the old papers, the archives,
And canker our histories’ lives.
[Verse 2]
Holding a mind under halter is hard,
Small is the split that can shiver the guard;
Hero may hearten yet heat us to ire,
Lied to from cradle with cradle-fire;
Oath-tight illusion, exactingly sworn,
News-trick and new-shriek make truth to be torn;
Want is their weapon and wage-rise’s woe,
Envy, e’en ending like gelding below.
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Brawl none more bootless beneath the blue sky—
Begging for gaze and cry.
[Chorus]
Hear, from afar, I a message thee bring;
False are the fables we fondly do sing;
Foully they forge the old papers, the archives,
And canker our histories’ lives.
[Chorus, chanting]
(oo-o-o-oo)
(oo-o-o-oo)
(oo-o-o-oo)
(oo-o-o-oo)
Hear, from afar, I a message thee bring;
Foully they forge the old papers, the archives of history.</code></pre></div><pre class="doc doc-raw card small"># I Bear Thee a Message (Viestin sulle tuon)
