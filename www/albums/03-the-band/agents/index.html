Album number 3. The material of first months of 2006, when I formed the band called The Vice.

Scope
- Band-identity era, first early 2006. Album 03 is published in both FI and EN; treat lyrics as final (not drafts). Lyrics lean confrontational, sardonic, and communal; 2025 curation of earlier works.

Content Notes (from .txt)
- Themes: rebellion and anti-hypocrisy (Eat Shit, Shitty City), friendship/crew identity (We’re the One True Band), melancholic romance (“She”), escape/aspiration (Into Space), refuge (The Treehouse).
- Tone: direct, cathartic, sometimes profane; FI originals with published EN adaptations/translations.
- Structures: compact verses with punchy prechoruses; chant-able, high-energy choruses.

Psychological Notes (light)
- Boundary repair: anger channels into firm limits and separation from exploitative figures.
- Moral injury: disillusionment with slackness, institutional hypocrisy, and “time theft”.
- Group belonging: band-as-identity mitigates isolation; shared voice and accountability.

Conventions
- Convert `.txt` → `.md` with sections (Inspiration/context, Structure, Lyrics FI/EN, Notes). Preserve strong register and explicit labels where used.
- Keep `.upp` separators intact; when normalizing `.tg` names to song titles, reflect in `.upp`.
- List `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` first in the `.upp` file list when present.

Next Actions
- Convert high-energy tracks first (clear chorus hooks aid structure capture).
- Tag explicit language in `.md` metadata; maintain original phrasing.
- Prepare cover image asset consistent with albums 01–05.
