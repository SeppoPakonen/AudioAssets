<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Made at Juha's parent's garage (in Oulu, Haapalehto) 11.9.2006, when we restarted our band activity after the Wayward broke in bad spirits earlier that year. This is actually the first song of the band called Vaikeat Ajat. We chose the band's name while making this song. Ville drew some VA logo to a cardboard, where V and A were joined together with the common line.</p>
<p>The song started from a joke, that "maybe we should start a trash metal band". Then, I actually found this riff and started to make a song with the garage computer and guitar pro software.</p>
<p>Refurbished 9.10.2022 by Seppo Pakonen I had to modify the composition quite significantly, because there were so many false notes. My old bandmates would not approve.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Composed: 11.9.2006</li>
</ul>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>Style & Energy: Dark, confident trap/pop-rap with melodic hooks. Minor key, moody but radio-friendly. Tempo: 140 BPM (double-time bounce), halftime feel in sections. Vocals; Lead: melodic rap with light Auto-Tune; catchy topline in the hook, tighter flow in verses. Secondary Vocals: airy harmonies + call-and-response ad-libs; occasional pitched doubles. Delivery: punchy, rhythmic, syncopated cadences; strategic pauses for beat to breathe. Drums: 808 kit front and center: sliding 808s with occasional glides and bends. Snare/clap on 3; crisp rimshots for fills. Hi-hats: trap triplets, 1/32 rolls, stutters, occasional open-hat lifts. Perc loops sparingly for texture; drops before hook impacts. Bass: Sub-heavy 808 as the hero; sidechained to kick for clean punch. Patterns switch between sustained notes in verse and more active slides in pre/chorus. Melodics: Minimalist motif: plucked bell or detuned synth lead (two-bar earworm). Supporting layers: filtered pad and/or reversed piano for atmosphere. Optional one-shot textures: vocal chop answering the hook.</p>

<p>Kehitä ihmistä, älä sääntöjä. Vaikka säännöt jää alitajutaan, ja niitä noudatetaan Jotkut säännöt vain haittaa Olisi parempi olla myös herkkä kontrasteille, joita tulee vastaan Olisi parempi mennä sen verran hitaammin, että ehtii harkita, ja punnita vaihtoehtoja mielessään</p>
<p>Develop the person, not the rules. They creep into the subconscious, followed without question, but some rules only hold us back. They’re chains we don’t see, habits we don’t challenge, systems we accept because they’re there. Pause. Look at the contrasts around you—choices that seem equal but pull you in different directions. Don’t just take the first path. Slow down, not to stop, but to see clearly. Weigh the options in your mind, let them breathe. The world moves fast, autumn leaves fall, winter’s dark snow buries the ground, but you don’t have to run blind. Question what binds you. Break what doesn’t serve. Choose your own way, not because it’s loud, but because it’s true.</p>
<p>Develop the person, not the rules. They sink deep, unnoticed, into the subconscious, shaping how we move, think, live. Rules—some are invisible, woven into habits we never question, carved into society’s expectations, heavy like frost on a winter morning. They tell us to keep going, to follow the path already worn, but some rules are walls, not guides. They block the view of what could be. Stop for a moment. Not to freeze, but to breathe. Notice the contrasts—the choices that tug at you, each one whispering a different future. Don’t rush to the first option just because it’s there, loud, familiar. Slow down enough to feel the weight of each possibility. Autumn’s decay scatters leaves across the ground; winter’s darkness cloaks the world in silence, snow burying yesterday’s tracks. Yet in that quiet, there’s clarity. You see the chains—habits you’ve outgrown, norms that don’t fit. You don’t have to break them with noise or force. Just see them. Question them. Let them crumble under the truth of who you are becoming. Every step is yours to choose, not because the world demands it, but because your own voice, steady and raw, calls you to something real.</p>

<p>Style: This is a high-energy rock track with a driving rhythm section and fast prominent male vocals / rap. The song is in a minor key, creating a dramatic and intense atmosphere. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar features distorted tones and plays both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines. The bass guitar provides a solid low-end foundation with a consistent, driving eighth-note pattern. The drums maintain a fast tempo with a strong backbeat, utilizing both snare and kick drum for emphasis. The male vocalist sings with a powerful, slightly raspy tone, delivering the lyrics with a sense of urgency and passion. The vocal melody is often syncopated, adding to the dynamic feel of the song. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format, with instrumental breaks that feature guitar solos. The production is clean and punchy, with all instruments clearly audible in the mix. The overall tempo is fast, contributing to the energetic and aggressive feel of the track.</p>

## Lyrics (EN)
Title: Not Loud, But Real

```
[Intro]
Make me, not rules, tonight, for real.
One breath, three doubts, one truth, three deals.

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Pause, breathe, see, slow.
Question the grip.
Blind habits write our moves, unchecked.
Frost scripts the dawn we heed, blind.
Walls pose as guides.
Norms fog the view.
Slow down enough to hear yourself.
Let each option breathe out, first.

[Prechorus 1]
I stake my doubt on truth, alone.
I break what keeps me small, for good.

[Chorus]
Not loud, but real, I choose my way.
Your rules don&#x27;t fit my bones, no more.
I won&#x27;t sprint blind through winter&#x27;s steel hush, I will see first.
I weigh the paths, then carve my own, with calm eyes.
My pace, my proof. No rush.

[Verse 2]
See stark divides.
Contrast gives proof.
Sacred cows block the exit door.
Polite lies choke growth from us.
Teach minds, not rules.
Name hidden scripts.
Systems serve people—or fail hard.
Choose clarity over fame.

[Prechorus 2]
I stake my doubt on light, within.
I cut the noise to hear what&#x27;s true.

[Chorus]
Not loud, but real, I choose my way.
Your rules don&#x27;t fit my bones, no more.
I won&#x27;t sprint blind through winter&#x27;s steel hush, I will see first.
I weigh the paths, then carve my own, with calm eyes.
My pace, my proof. No rush.

[Chorus]
Not loud, but real, I choose my way.
Your rules don&#x27;t fit my bones, no more.
I won&#x27;t sprint blind through winter&#x27;s steel hus h, I will see first.
I weigh the paths, then carve my own, with calm eyes.
My pace, my proof. No rush.

[Bridge 1]
If rules are chains, I&#x27;ll file them, down slow.
If norms are fog, I&#x27;ll wait out the drift.
If power says hush, I&#x27;ll answer with silence, then voice raised.
If speed is worship, I honor the seeing, and choice made.

[Instrumental]

[Prechorus 3]
I stake my doubt on breath and sight.
I keep what makes me grow, no myth.

[Chorus]
Not loud, but real, I choose my way.
Your rules don&#x27;t fit my bones, no more.
I won&#x27;t sprint blind through winter&#x27;s steel hush, I will see first.
I weigh the paths, then carve my own, with calm eyes.
My pace, my proof. No rush.

[Chorus]
Not loud, but real, I choose my way.
Your rules don&#x27;t fit my bones, no more.
I won&#x27;t sprint blind through winter&#x27;s steel hush, I will see first.
I weigh the paths, then carve my own, with calm eyes.
My pace, my proof. No rush.
