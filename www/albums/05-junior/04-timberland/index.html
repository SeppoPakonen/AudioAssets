## Background
This was one beat for PMS that went nowhere.

## Inspiration text
```
Sano aa, leikitään lääkärii.
Kylmäl stetoskoopil täytyy kuunnella sun tissii.
Vähän vaatetta vähemmäks pliis.
Vanhoil konsteil sun hysteriaa hoitaisin.
Sanon avaa ja sinä avaat, ei suuta, vaan haarojas.
Se ei satu missään.
Käteni eivät harhaile; ne seikkailee.
```

### AI
```
The hospital glows under sleek fluorescent lights, sterile and sharp, but the air hums with something electric. After hours, the corridors are quiet, save for the faint beep of a monitor somewhere far off. The doctor adjusts his coat, stethoscope dangling like a prop in their game. She’s waiting in the exam room, not a patient but a partner in this late-night ritual. A little less clothing, she’s already shedding layers, her eyes locked on his, daring him to take control. His hands move with purpose, not to heal but to tease, tracing lines that blur professional and primal.

Say aa, he murmurs, voice low, almost a growl, and she parts her lips, but it’s not her mouth he’s after. The cold stethoscope presses against her skin, sending a shiver through her. No pain, she whispers, but her body says otherwise, arching toward his touch. He’s the doctor, real enough to know anatomy, meta enough to know this is a dance of power and surrender. Old tricks for new thrills—his fingers linger, deliberate, as she leans into the role of the submissive, here for the pleasure, not the cure.

Her pulse races, and he doesn’t need a chart to read it. The room feels smaller, the air thick with want. My hands don’t wander, he says, but they do, exploring every curve like it’s his prescription. She’s not here for hysteria but for the heat, the game, the way his commands make her feel alive. Open, he says, and she does, offering herself to the rhythm of their unspoken agreement. The hospital’s sterile facade fades; this is their playground now, where boundaries dissolve and desire rules.

Chorus (Patient’s Voice):
I’m here for the rush, doc, give me that cure. Touch me where it hurts, make my body purr. Your hands know the way, no need for a chart. Play the game rough, you’re tearing me apart.

Bridge (Patient’s Voice):
This ain’t no clinic, it’s our secret sin. Lock the door tight, let the real work begin. You’re the doc, I’m the spark, let’s burn through the night. Take me to the edge, make it feel so right.

Title: Bagels &amp; Baguettes
```
[Intro — spoken]
Lights drop, door clicks;
night shift turns bakery—bagels and baguettes on the tray,
protocols primed,
doctor audits hunger at full voltage.

[Verse 1, female rapping]
Say “ah,” but I’m eyeing the ring.
Fluorescents buzz like ovens in spring.
Lab coat swagger, KPI: rise.
Cold scope taps; you roll your eyes.
“Less fabric, please”—keep it low-tech.
Old-world cure with a fresh baguette.
Stitch up distance, cut the doubt.
No malpractice—playbook mapped out.
You lock eyes; I time the beat.
Boardroom heat meets bakery street.
“Open,” I mutter—not lips but a door.
Show me the bagel; I’ll check the core.
“No pain,” you grin, but the meter says “more.”
Roadmap to glaze through the clinic floor.
My hands don’t wander; they benchmark crumb.
Every curve a shelf; let the timers hum.

[Chorus, female singing]
Bring out the bagels—serve them hot tonight.
Wave that baguette like a night-shift rite.
Skip the chart—read glaze and crumb.
Run the ovens till the buzzers hum.
Bagels up, baguettes up—run the ovens, run the night.
Bagels up, baguettes up—run the ovens, run the night.

[Verse 2, male rapping]
Stethoscope ticks like a breadline clock.
HIPAA of crumbs—none leave the block.
Old tricks, new heat, simple and blunt,
Write me a script: butter up the front.
Triage the tremor; forecast the steam.
Quarterly target: rise like a dream.
You say “I heal,” I say “I toast.”
Hysteria’s ghost meets bakery host.
Not chasing cures—chasing the bite.
Clinical bakery, after-hours night.
“Open,” again, agenda item two—
Bagel displayed, audit coming through.
No saints in scrubs, just players in white,
Baguette on the line like a neon light.
My hands “don’t wander”—they measure the crust.
Sign off the moment: approved for lust.

[Chorus, female singing]
Bring out the bagels—serve them hot tonight.
Wave that baguette like a night-shift rite.
Skip the chart—read glaze and crumb.
Run the ovens till the buzzers hum.

[Bridge, male singing]
Hush—late shift bakery, papers stamped tonight.
Lock the hatch; let dough ignite now.
Heat for show, spark for the loaf tonight.
Edge the timer, ring now.

[Chorus, female singing]
Bring out the bagels—serve them hot tonight.
Wave that baguette like a night-shift rite.
Skip the chart—read glaze and crumb.
Run the ovens till the buzzers hum.
Bagels up, baguettes up—run the ovens, run the night.
Bagels up, baguettes up—run the ovens, run the night.

Title: Hysteria Protocol
```
[Intro — spoken]
(aa, aa)
Lights drop, door clicks; fantasy greenlit—protocols primed, doctor auditing desire at full voltage.
(mhm-mhm)
 
[Verse 1, male rapping]
Say “ah,” but the brief says “own the frame.”
Fluorescents buzz—Q4 lust, after-hours game.
Lab coat swagger, KPI: your pulse.
Cold scope kisses, compliance still holds.
“Less fabric, please”—deliverables clear.
Hysteria cure? Old tricks, new gear.
Stitch the distance, suture the doubt.
No malpractice—playbook sorted out.
You lock eyes; I clock vitals in code.
Power dynamics—risk properly load-balanced mode.
“Open,” I murmur—not lips but a gate.
You tilt a grin; we iterate fate.
“No pain,” you whisper, body says “more.”
Roadmap to pleasure through a clinic door.
My hands don’t wander; they audit and roam.
Exploration budget: every curve a home.

[Chorus, female singing]
I’m here, doc—dose me right
Touch where it aches; meters sing tonight
Dump the chart—read skin for the signs.
Run the night shift till the vitals ring.
No chart—just the signal, yes.
No chart—just the signal.

[Verse 2, male rapping]
Stethoscope tick, like a metronome sin.
HIPAA of secrets—no leaks, just grin.
Old-school methods with a modern twist,
Write me a script: heat, tease, and mist.
Triage the tremor, forecast the sweat,
Shareholder passion: best outcome yet.
You say, “I heal,” I say, “I burn.”
Hysteria’s ghost? We make it unlearn.
Not here for cures—here for the drive,
Clinical theater where kinks stay alive.
“Open,” again, agenda item two,
Governance of gasp: approved by you.
No saints in scrubs, just players in white,
Surgical banter in the dead of night.
My hands “don’t wander”—they benchmark the skin,
Quarterly targets: you shiver, we win.

[Chorus, female singing]
I’m here, doc—dose me right tonight.
Touch where it aches; make the meters sing.
Dump the chart—read skin for the signs.
Run the night shift till the vitals ring.
No chart—just the signal, yes.

[Bridge, female singing]
Hush—adults only, house rules bite tonight.
Lock it tight; let roles ignite now.
You heal for show, I spark for truth tonight.
Edge me safe and right now.

[Chorus, female singing]
I’m here, doc—dose me right tonight.
Touch where it aches; make the meters sing.
Dump the chart—read skin for the signs.
Run the night shift till the vitals ring.
No chart—just the signal, yes.
